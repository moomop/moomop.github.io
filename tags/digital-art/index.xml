      <description>Text or other blocky elements entwined with background images is a look that’s often used in stickers and planners, and although it looks doable - it’s only combining a few elements together - I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even worked out how to use custom fonts on Procreate, let alone how to only show part of a rasterised text layer without just erasing. But now, after following along with a tutorial published by Holly Pixels (update from the future: no longer available), I&amp;rsquo;ve at least got somewhere on it.</description>
