      <description>When an email went round at work asking if anyone was up for giving a lunchtime talk on a hobby, I volunteered to do so. I’ve got to be honest that I did suspect ‘static site personal blogging’ might be considered a bit too esoteric for them to accept, but no, they took me up on it. Whelp!
