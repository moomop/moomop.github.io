      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s blowing a hooley out there again, pun intended. Unfortunately, it also did the same on my return to running club this week; sunny before, sunny after, but during a torrential thunderstorm. Two days later and I might be dry but my trainers are still sopping. It&amp;rsquo;s also the day parkrun, a worldwide organisation that helps volunteers run free, weekly, timed 5k events, of which there are hundreds in the UK have confirmed their events won&amp;rsquo;t be back in England on June 5th; but more on that later.</description>
