      <description>I did it! That is, I finally completed the London marathon 21st April 2024, with a time of 6:33:02. Oh my gosh, has this ever been a lot of hard work – I’ve effectively trained for it three times after first the delays of the pandemic pushed it into 2023, then injury meaning I had to defer to 2024. So my initial reaction to crossing the line was really just one of relief&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally there&amp;hellip; that is past the longest run of training, past the last long run of tapering even, and it&amp;rsquo;s looking more likely than not that 2024 will be the year I really make it to the start line of the London marathon. It&amp;rsquo;s now ~1.5 weeks to go – I&amp;rsquo;m nervous, excited&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>A new running thing… but not in London</title>

      <description>Ok, so for those who don’t know, the London marathon didn’t happen for me this year. I think I’ve always been clear that there was a bit of an ‘if’ getting to the start line. When you are pushing yourself doing runs that are that far, there’s always a risk of picking up an injury&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I decided to enter the Sandy 10 this year after learning that it was the 40th anniversary of this race and realising that I had run the 30th anniversary race, which I think was my very first race as a member of NHRR&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It’s January. And, for a lot of people, at this time of year, there’s a renewed focus on fitness goals. This isn’t quite the case for me, as I’ve been training for the three-year marathon (yep, still plan to do it, injury excepting) since the start of October. Not quite training like I managed in 2019 and early 2020 but&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>When there’s a big banner for a 10 km race staring at you if you glance out of your office window, it does seem rude not to enter. Mind, this was back pre-pandemic in 2019, not long after I learnt I’d got a 2020 London marathon ballot place and at a point I could actually run a full 10 km&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It was great news when I heard that the club had arranged for us to take part in the Herts Sunday cross country league, the winter sister competition to our usual summer interclub competition. As I prepared, I was very pleased to find that I&amp;rsquo;d had some forethought 2 years ago, and had loosened the spikes in the cross country shoes, so they weren’t rusted in place&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Today saw the return of the Duck n Dash aquathlon for its 11th year. This is an annual favourite for me, combining a 400 m lane swim in the Letchworth outdoor pool with a 5 km run round Norton Common&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Getting a ballot place in the London marathon is a lucky thing. London marathon don&amp;rsquo;t publish the number of ballot places that they have, but estimates I&amp;rsquo;ve read say it&amp;rsquo;s ~17,000. We do know that there are usually ~40,000 runners&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s blowing a hooley out there again, pun intended. Unfortunately, it also did the same on my return to running club this week; sunny before, sunny after, but during a torrential thunderstorm. Two days later and I might be dry but my trainers are still sopping. It&amp;rsquo;s also the day parkrun, a worldwide organisation that helps volunteers run free, weekly, timed 5k events, of which there are hundreds in the UK have confirmed their events won&amp;rsquo;t be back in England on June 5th; but more on that later.</description>
