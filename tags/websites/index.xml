      <description>In my previous post about setting up the blog, we were at the stage of having decided on, and got at least somewhere, with getting Hugo working to generate a website, but with much design still to do. And although design can be just going with your preferred template for the content, I want a little more input than that because I do just want a &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; that says &amp;lsquo;coffee now&amp;rsquo; to me, like when you&amp;rsquo;re sat on the sofa with a coffee.</description>
