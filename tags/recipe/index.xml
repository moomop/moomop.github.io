      <description>Our damson tree had an unusually large crop of fruit this year, so I decided to make a batch of jam. The recipe below details what appears to have worked well. It was adapted from a plum jam recipe found in the book Jams &amp;amp; Chutneys, although the original recipe was for about half the quantity and gave the preparation time as an implausible 20 mins&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally there&amp;hellip; that is past the longest run of training, past the last long run of tapering even, and it&amp;rsquo;s looking more likely than not that 2024 will be the year I really make it to the start line of the London marathon. It&amp;rsquo;s now ~1.5 weeks to go – I&amp;rsquo;m nervous, excited&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I’m writing this on ‘National Cream Tea Day’ not long after I succumbed to scone fever with two recent events requiring the baking of scones. However, it’s not me doing the baking - James is the one who’s rather good at scones - so much so, I call his scones ‘the clouds’. Hence, another recipe-sharing blog post&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I do love a good kebab - one place I lived even had a fabulous kebab van complete with its own fresh tabbouleh. A staple of the takeaway kebab is also a pickled chilli; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dream of picking it out to throw away&amp;hellip;</description>
