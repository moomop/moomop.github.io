      <description>Here, I&amp;rsquo;m bringing together all 19 book reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve written for fantasy books read in 2024, as originally published on my Bookwyrm account. With the exception of cookbooks, fantasy has always been my most prevalent reading genre (although I’ll admit there’s a bit of presenting myself in a certain way on the internet here as, yes, I do read quite a few light romances too)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s a given that whenever there&amp;rsquo;s some form of software update, I&amp;rsquo;m going to initially dislike it. First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s the disruption of the update itself, waiting for something to download and restart until I get my program back, no doubt occurring at the most inconvenient moment. But then there&amp;rsquo;s also just that it is a change. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I genuinely hate change of course&amp;hellip;</description>
