[{"content":"It’s been a very long time since I’ve given a formal talk on one of my hobbies; in fact, I haven’t done one since an exceptionally distant high-school English class.\nI think, for being in my mid-teens, I did alright in that talk (it was on fossils); at least, I recall that’s what my teacher said. I also remember the best talk in my class was the one done by a young gentleman on playing guitar – although my teacher was not insensible to the fact that talking on (as well as playing on) something primarily designed to be entertaining gives you some audience advantage.\nEspecially when the audience is teenagers (although it was an acoustic guitar).\nAnyway, I digress. In fact, I often digress because I deliberately write these posts as if I’m talking to you (although with less ‘urmmm’). That’s just the style you’re going to get when reading my stuff.\n So, back to topic, when an email went round at work asking if anyone was up for giving a lunchtime talk (a strict 30-min slot) on a hobby, I volunteered to do so.\nI’ve got to be honest that I did suspect ‘static site personal blogging’ might be considered a bit too esoteric for them to accept, but no, they took me up on it. Whelp!\nThat’s now done, so, to record the details, I’m also writing it up as a few – maybe it’ll run to three, we’ll see – blog posts.\nHence, here is part I of ‘Building an IndieWeb house: the why and hows of Coffee Now’. We’ll cover what is the IndieWeb, what is a website and writing in markdown here, with using the static site generator (SSG) Hugo, syndicating elsewhere and some things I’ve learnt in the process to follow in future posts.\nBecause the talk was given to a general audience, readers might know a good deal of what’s below. However, I still hope it’s of interest – or at the very least somewhat interesting – to those coming across this post!\nWhat is the IndieWeb? IndieWeb websites are personal sites that follow these two basic principles:\n They run under your own domain name They act as your primary (public) online identity  The reason for starting such a site is often a response to enshittification (at work, I might have said ‘platform decay’, but that was at work – Cory Doctorow\u0026rsquo;s term is the most common!).\nSo what do I mean by that?\nWell, when James and I started ‘coffee now’ in 2021, although AI slop was less common than it is now, it was still clear that social media and the web was getting more and more about the interests of the platform/page and less about your interests.\nIndeed, although you get enshittification in other circumstances (operating systems showing adverts on the lock screen or defaulting to storing your stuff in their cloud platforms, then charging for that privilege), the reason for starting your own website is often because of enshittification of social media services.\n If you IndieWeb, then it can be different. You can build your own house.   Just how bad this now is very obvious when scrolling through my feed in a major commercial social media platform (one that I don’t use very much these days for just this reason).\nI counted up that it was only three out of the first 17 posts that I was shown that were things I’d actually signed up to see.\n‘Highlights’ of the other posts included an advert for weight loss treatment (uggg), posts from a group where I’d visited their webpage that obviously had a tracker I hadn’t blocked, and a post from Oxford parkrun (complete with a creepy AI image of some characters on a tandem that could never work), because obviously I’m interested in a random parkrun event halfway across the country from where I live.\nAt least one post might have even been shown to me for the purpose of rage baiting.\nI simply don’t want to be forcing those I know to sign up to such services (giving away personal information in the process) and to see that sort of mess just to follow a few silly low-key updates about my life. Not to mention social media platforms are potentially about more than commercial capitalism these days.\nAll in all, if you only post your content in such silos, or even in other blogging platforms (Medium, Substack, Blogger etc.), you’re also only renting your space and are vulnerable to changes in how those platforms operate.\nIncluding them disappearing altogether.\n As the person who posted this on social media said, \u0026quot;once seen, never forgotten\u0026quot;.\n  If you IndieWeb, then it can be different. You can build your own house.\nAnd that’s where a reason for doing this that’s more positive comes in. As part of the IndieWeb, I have much more control of how I want content to be presented. I can have images in the middle of posts, long-form content and write what I want, how I want (well, within the law, including the UK Online Safety Act).\nBlogging is a creative hobby.\nAnd it’s not about eschewing mainstream social media altogether; we can choose to share content from our IndieWeb site where we like.\nIndieWeb is hence formalised in two concepts:\n POSSE: Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere PESOS: Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site  I’m not a purist about following either the POSSE or PESOS system; most stuff is here first, then shared elsewhere via a link, the POSSE way, but if you take my recent book review post, that was indeed published elsewhere first.\nI also don’t publish everything here; this blog does really confine itself to long-form content that won’t change much over time, and that stays up.\nShort posts, or throw-away content, are most likely be found over on my personal Mastodon account, and most of that is deleted after 6 months. (In fact, I delete most stuff on all my social media accounts fairly often, even from platforms that make you do it manually post by post, not so much for privacy reasons but because content like that doesn’t make sense out of the time, and hence context, in which it was written.)\nRight, so after covering a brief bit of the whys, let’s get down to some hows – how do we go about publishing on own site?\nPublish (on your) own site I have nothing to write about When I tell people I do a personal blog (as opposed to a topic blog), one of those most common responses I get is “oh, I couldn’t do that; I have nothing to write about”.\nI have to say my response, is generally “I don’t believe that”.\nThat’s not meant to disparage; it’s just I know I’d be interested in a site written by anyone I know!\nFirst, as I’ve alluded to, a blog, even a personal blog, doesn’t have to be by just one person. Here, James and I both contribute.\nWe weren’t sure that would be best at first, but given some posts have indeed been written by both of us together, it has made sense over the years. [It would have even been very odd if the posts on our wedding didn’t feature us both as authors!]\nThis also means that whenever either of us do something a bit out of the ordinary (i.e. whether that’s me running the London marathon or James walking the West Highland Way), we’ll get posts out of it. Usually this amounts to a post every couple of months.\nAlso, although long-form blogging is not always a quick process, that isn’t what you have to do to run an IndieWeb site.\nYou can also do this as a:\n a digital garden, meaning pages where content is added, updated and ‘pruned’ rather than being stuff that rarely changes (Maggie Appleton\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;A Brief History \u0026amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden\u0026rsquo; and Joel Hook\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;My blog is a digital garden, not a blog\u0026rsquo; explain more). a ‘currently’ page: ‘I’m current reading…’, ‘I’m currently listening to…’ a collection of interesting links or week notes (especially as search is another thing that’s enshittifying to the extent that you don’t find articles via search engines as easily as you once did; an example of such a blog is bob\u0026rsquo;s ramblings).  Buying a domain name I’ve said that having your own domain name is important. That’s because once you have this, then this is something that can stick with you, as your identity, forever (well, as long as you keep up the registrar fees).\nBut what is a domain name?\n If you take one of the URLs for a post here, the domain name comprises the bit you choose (‘moomop’ – don’t ask) plus the top level domain (tld), here ‘.uk’.\nDifferent tlds are controlled by different registrars, and the UK tlds (.uk, .co.uk, .me.uk etc.) are controlled by the UK public-benefit company Nominet. [In fact an early brush with where to buy services led us to avoiding buying our domain name from a supplier that supported 2021 efforts to commercialise Nominet, something that we\u0026rsquo;re glad didn\u0026rsquo;t happen.]\nThe other parts of the URL comprise the subdomain, which isn’t necessary, but something that we’ve chosen here to link back to the title of this blog (and to give more flexibility if we ever wanted other websites under the same domain name), and the slug (ideally short and giving a idea of what the URL will be about).\nWhat is a website? OK, so we’ve decided to make an (IndieWeb) website, but what actually does that mean? What even is a website?\nThe way I like to think about this is that a website is a collection of content that’s accessed via URL.\nThe content is made up of three components:\nFirst, HTML – the underpinning ‘DNA’ of the website. [ok, bit cringy but I am, or at least was, a biologist.]\nHTML is made up of ‘elements’, most often text given a ‘purpose’ by surrounding opening and closing tags in angle brackets.\nExamples of elements would be: \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;A big title\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A standard paragraph\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\nSecond, ‘cascading styles sheets’ (CSS); CSS provides styles (colour, size, position etc.) to HTML elements.\nWithout CSS, you get stuck with browser defaults for the styles.\nThere’s even a CSS naked day every April 9th, where websites might take off their CSS, revealing the underlying HTML structure!\n My book review post, naked of CSS. Some styles are applied for the labelled HTML elements but it\u0026rsquo;s all very basic.\n  And finally, JavaScript; this is script written into the website source code that is run by your browser.\nWhereas I have either written, or at least understand, all the CSS on the website, that isn’t true of the JavaScript.\nHowever, we’re careful to only use JavaScript we trust, given that it can be used for purposes we wouldn’t want (for example, it can track mouse positions and scrolls, the time spent on a website, and pull in external sources of scripts and content – and many, if not most websites, although notably not Mastodon, have webpages that do this if you don’t use a tracker blocker).\nHere, JavaScript is only used to make the image galleries, do a little animation (when CSS won’t quite cut it), and to power the syntax highlighting and search, but it’s perfectly possible to run a blog without any JavaScript at all (aside: or to do it in a platform like \u0026lsquo;React\u0026rsquo; where there’s a lot of JavaScript).\nDynamic vs static sites So, if a website is HTML, CSS and JavaScript, how are websites actually made?\nWell, there are two different types of website, dynamic sites and static sites.\nStarting with dynamic sites, they run from web servers as below:\n Although there are many, many different content management system (CMS) programs that run dynamic sites, the most commonly known is probably the PHP-based program WordPress.\nTaking this as an example, WordPress would live on the web server.\nThen, when your browser contacts the web server, the WordPress program runs, taking information from and/or writing information to the database, in this case an SQL database, processing the outcome and sending HTML, CSS and JavaScript back to the browser.\nWhat is apparent from this set-up is that someone is going to need to keep everything up to date to make sure there are no vulnerabilities in the WordPress set up (or most often its plugins), because that can be exploited to corrupt your website.\nThe classic example is an SQL injection attack – when inputs aren’t sanitised such as you end up with a user being able to modify your database. Indeed, even today, if databases aren’t secured properly, people can be found modifying your website (see 404 media’s report on waste[.]gov).\nAs well as this, such a system means databases are modified on the fly. This means you also need to start making database backups on the fly.\nBut there’s a simpler way to make a website.\n Cut out the database, just put your files with HTML, CSS and JavaScript directly on the web server, and make what’s called a static site.\nThe issue is how far would we get writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript by hand. Can you imagine typing all those HTML angle brackets!?\nWell fortunately, for HTML, there’s help on hand here, in the form of markdown, files with the extension ‘.md.’\nMarkdown Markdown files are plain text and are designed as a way to write HTML more quickly; indeed, even in some CMSs you might find yourself writing in markdown, as in many ways it’s often easier than using a WYSIWYG editor.\nWikipedia shows the basics of how you write in markdown; e.g. ‘#’ symbols are used to denote a line of text as a heading element, line breaks are used to denote paragraph elements etc. You can also see more in an online tool to give writing markdown a go yourself.\nHTML itself is also valid markdown, but for security reasons, not all markdown applications support it; however, if you trust the person writing your blog posts (you), it’s a good idea to set your system to allow you to break out into HTML directly. This means you can add something not covered by the basic syntax on a one-off basis for a post.\n I firmly believe that if you can manage to use a complicated full word processor, like MS Word, Apple Pages or LibreOffice Writer, then you can easily write markdown, although you probably want to do so in a syntax editor to help highlight styles.\nMarkdown being a open format means you also never have the problem of finding you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to open it somewhere. The popular (although proprietary) note-taking tool Obsidian also uses markdown for its notes, so it\u0026rsquo;s not something you only come across in the context of websites.\nAs a real example, some of the markdown for the book post is below:\n\u0026lt;!--- This first part is for providing information to the SSG and is called \u0026#39;front matter\u0026#39; --\u0026gt; --- title: \u0026#34;A 2024 reading round up\u0026#34; slug: book-reviews-2024 date: 2025-01-12 author: - Clare tags: - book reviews - review - reading - fantasy literature --- \u0026lt;!--- The post starts here, notice the bracketed terms for making links --\u0026gt; Here, I\u0026#39;m bringing together all 19 book reviews I\u0026#39;ve written for fantasy books read in 2024, as originally published on [my Bookwyrm account](https://ramblingreaders.org/user/clare_hooley).

Carrick A trilogy written by two authors under the pen name of M. A. Carrick. It follows the stories of multiple characters as they try and negotiate the turbulence of life in the Renaissance Venice-inspired city of Nadežra.\nOur main protagonist is Ren, a city native (who are usually of Vraszenian or part-Vraszenian race), who has returned to Nadežra after being forced to flee it after betraying the sinister leader of their group (knot) of child thieves. Together with her sister, Tess, we first meet her as she is trying to move up in the world by executing a con trick passing herself off as the daughter of an estranged relative of one of the ruling Liganti-race gentry families – the Traementis family – in order to be taken in by them officially.\nThe series then follows her life as she gets caught up first in political intrigue and then hectical magics, and then takes up the fight to protect both her city and new-found friends and family.\nThe Mask of Mirrors (Rook and Rose, #1)  5 stars out of 5    Publisher: Orbit Copyright year: 2021 ISBN: 978-0-356-51516-8  Expertly crafted political fantasy  In this first book, we\u0026rsquo;re introduced to Ren as she negotiates her initial con, helped along by her marvellously fun, and sometimes scandalous, appearances as a fashionista (all delightfully enhanced by Tess’s skill as a seamstress and ‘imbued’ make up), and ends up more invested in the dealings of the Traementis. Of course, this means she is inevitably dragged into the complexities of the city, as she, along with our many many secondary characters, come up against the interests of the powerful Indestor family and some dark forces.\nAs just a flavour of the stand outs among our cast, there’s Leato, the outwardly happy-go-lucky Traementis heir, his friend Captain Grey Serrado, a rare Vraszenian member of a mostly corrupt police force, the crime lord Vargo, who has unlikely specialised knowledge of numinatria, a geometrical magic system practiced by the Liganti, and a hooded vigilante, know only as the Rook, who is a hero to the Vraszenian populace.\nOf these, Vargo is a notable highlight – neither us as readers, nor indeed Ren, the gentry or the criminal underworld, are able to quite follow his motivations as he both ruthlessly uses others and yet also seems to take real risks to his own safety in pursuit of an unknown goal.\nIt’s indeed remarkable that everybody is fully realised and that the authors manage to link everybody, and every place, to their various factions with the necessary subtly. The different races, different classes and different magics (there’s a Vraszenian tarot-style magic system that’s is contrasts nicely with the numinatria) interweave with true expertise. However, the shear number of characters, and the varied political, religious/magical and social interconnections, do make initially make this an intimidating read.\nAlthough the authors have provided a helpful Dramatis Personae list, you have to be very much on it at all times to follow who’s who – for me, it would have been easier going if official roles were included as part of gentry titles. This would prevent much flicking back to check details in the glossary/character list. Mind then again, I also enjoyed that the book didn’t hand hold you through it all too much. In a strange way, the reader’s confusion helped me feel at one with Ren trying to keep the different threads of her life apart as the story progresses.\nAll in all, I find this is an exceptional tale, with vibrant characters expertly set in a beguiling city. Although we have some changes of pace, and the first half of the book is notably slower, I was never frustrated, but rather revelled in extra time to catch up my thoughts.\nDespite a very few negatives, such as a couple of unnecessary scenes (including a whole section on a curse that’s not explained and too easily resolved) and that the city seems just a bit too self contained (meaning Ren can pull off some aspects of the con a bit too easily), the authors manage to captivate you for over 600 pages.\nOne to read, re-read, and then move onto the sequels quickly before you forget the nuances.\nThe Liar\u0026rsquo;s Knot (Rook and Rose, #2)  5 stars out of 5    Publisher: Orbit Copyright year: 2022 ISBN: 978-0-356-51518-2  Found family, sumptuous world-building and intricate politics  Here, we continue with story of Ren, a would-be con artist, who’s achieved her goal of being accepted as a full member of the noble House Traementis in the city of Nadežra.\nHowever, Ren’s now a long way from her main motivations being those she started with, as she has a new tangled web of heart and home considerations to think of at every turn.\nThe primary thrust of this second book takes us back to the mysterious curse on House Traementis, something that was introduced a bit too hurriedly in the first book.\nWho or what is it that has the power to so profoundly affect families so as to cause entire family lines to die out? Why is the crime lord Vargo seemingly also so interested in this problem? How does this link to the 200 years of tension between the Vraszenian and Liganti people within Nadežra?\nAnd how is Ren going to reconcile the above with her new and unlooked-for third persona, that of the Black Rose? [Poor Ren! Never mind the two guises she already has as part of her con, being the Black Rose means now she has responsibility to do what’s right by the general Vraszenian populace of the city too].\nNo doubt, but for me these issues make for a truly sumptuous plot, and I’m fine if there’s sometimes a rather meandering story path as each of our three main characters have various parts of puzzle at various times (as well as Ren, both Vargo and Grey Serrado get full arcs and take on substantial POV sections).\nI especially adored learning the truth behind Vargo. In fact, our first scene is a gritty flashback where we see just how Vargo becomes attached to the spirit that lives in his spider Peabody, and thus starts on the path of his meteoric rise from slum street kid to nobility. [And if you haven’t read the first book, and think the ‘spirit in the spider’ thing just sounds too silly to be real, well yes it is, but no it’s not, all at the same time! These authors are not afraid to have fun with their fantasy].\nAlthough, the sheer number of names does mean you have to fully pay attention (and make use of the Dramatis Personae and glossary), I wouldn’t want it any other way – I’m all in to work at fully embracing this lush and dramatic world.\nDespite some serious themes (lies, trust, love, greed, spirituality…), there’s just so much more when those are mixed with a good dose of fashion, flirtation and swashbuckling action to give a multi-layered book.\nAny fans of political fantasy should be reading this series.\nLabyrinth\u0026rsquo;s Heart (Rook and Rose, #3)  5 stars out of 5    Publisher: Orbit Copyright year: 2023 ISBN: 978-0-356-51520-5  A finale worthy of the world  After the dramatic events at the end of The Liar\u0026rsquo;s Knot, we enter this book aware of what’s behind the much of the ill our main characters, Ren, Vargo and Grey, are fighting.\nThe trouble is, although these three are now revealed and reconciled with each other in all their various guises, having become embroiled in multiple personas or other lies, at some point it was inevitable there would be consequences of such deceptions.\nFor Ren, however much she adores the new family she’s gained by becoming Traementis, it’s based on a falsehood, and it’s really the work that she does in her Vraszenian guises of Arenza Lensky and The Black Rose that she’s passionate about. Is there any way for her to not break with the Traementis while following her heart?\nFor Vargo, and his spider, he somehow needs to keep the trust of those he relies on when he’s not truly as bound to their causes as he claims.\nFor Grey, well… he had an exceptional resource at his disposal, but owing to his conflicts he’s cast it aside; how does he go forwards now he’s a different person?\nSo as these three, and numerous supporting characters, are thrown into their biggest challenge – finally ridding Nadežra of maline influence once and for all – they also have to deal with the how the wider Vraszenian and Liganti populace reacts as they see the real person behind the masks.\nI won’t lie and say the plot is always skilfully handled here; it’s certainly not. In particular, the outcome of one of the main denouncements felt particularly episodic as if the writers were, “OK, we must deal with that, OK that’s done, close it off quickly, move on”.\nI will also say that the authors do resolve every plot thread, and that’s some task in a series this complex, making for a lot of endings – we learn about Ren’s origins, the spider, the bodyguard, even some whys behind how the Vraszenian tarot-based magic links with Liganti number-based magic.\nDespite the negatives in plotting, I still can’t bring myself to be anything but fully positive about the series; it’s innovative, it has captivating characters and the backdrop of Nadežra is just deliciously well realised. Race and class conflicts, as well as what it means to have a mixed heritage, are not easy concepts to bring into a fantasy, especially when we also have so much fun, silly banter and action.\nAnd finally, I’m never not going to have a soft spot for any fantasy where our heroine relies on smarts and not a sword.\nI’m off to go back to Mask of Mirrors and start it all over again.\n The Scholomance trilogy by Naomi Novik Young-adult fantasy told in first person through the eyes of El, a 3rd year (initially ~16 years old) female student in the ‘Scholomance’, the magic school of the series title.\nWe as reader are thrown directly into El\u0026rsquo;s life at the school, which is completely cut off from the outside world of the adult wizards (there are no teachers here); there’s magical monsters at every turn, work assignments that turn deadly, contaminated food, bullies and cliques, and a good dose of adolescent angst.\nWill El survive and, if she does, what place will she have in the world beyond the school?\nA Deadly Education (The Scholomance, #1)  4 stars out of 5    Publisher: Cornerstone Copyright year: 2020 ISBN: 978-1-473-57783-1  A delicious coming of age magic school fantasy  In this first book of the series, we are taken a-pace through a series of the school’s non-stop horrors as we learn most of the students die in increasingly gruesome ways. In fact, it’s all quite a good deal of macabre fun, and told with much delightful malice.\nOne of the main themes is how much easier life is if you come from a position of privilege, in this case meaning that you enter the school from a specific ‘enclave’, and thus have a ready-made support network. Without this, students such as El need to find or join such a network by brilliance, drudgery or even offering themselves as cannon fodder.\nEl, however, is so cantankerous, she pushes everyone away and can’t get into the position to show that she is brilliant, namely she has very powerful spells. Although that makes her interesting, it is definitely frustrating that we have an awful lot of text dedicated to her self pity, stubborn pride and even her trying to talk herself out of both.\nAs a counterpoint, we thankfully have the ‘enclaver’ Orion, also acting as romantic interest, who has a gift that means he is courted by all rather than being seen as a person, showing that privilege isn’t necessarily all wonderful either (or at least in this school).\nThe book would be better if we directly switched to other points of view to contrast with El’s everlasting sardonic inner monologue, but I can see that would be complicated for the intended audience. The other negative is that the world is just a too far out there to be believable – as bemoaned by El, it is really is just far too non-stop – but suspend all that because I just need to know how are characters are going to survive graduation, and that’s the next book…\nThe Last Graduate (The Scholomance, #2)  4 stars out of 5    Publisher: Penguin Books Copyright year: 2021 ISBN: 978-1-473-57784-8  More delicious malevolence  This novel starts exactly where we left off in the first book with our two main protagonists, our narrator El and and her perhaps boyfriend Orion, now seniors in the deadly school.\nThe end of the senior year is when both of them will face ‘graduation’ – a literal gauntlet run through a room filled with wicked hungry magical monsters (always deliciously well-described by Novik’s writing) that, in a standard year, only about half those entering survive. Of course with El and Orion both being so exceptional, we know this isn’t going to be a standard year.\nEl has mellowed out (grown up) from being quite so whiny and angsty, although her sarcastic streak remains undimmed, and now even has friends. Owing to events at the end of book one, she also can’t be invisible to anyone anymore. This character development makes the book stronger and more engaging than before. I will say though, that the ongoing romance between El and Orion is a bit hormone-driven for me, but that’s not out of keeping with the context and age of the characters.\nAfter the first third of the book sees El fighting her way through difficulties much as per book book one, we get a change in the second half, as lessons end and it all becomes about practice for graduation, with plenty more school politics as alliances are formed, then broken, then formed again. At least at first, the overriding theme of the series so far, how different it is for haves and have nots, is continued.\nIn the last third of the book, the twist is gradually revealed; it’s not a give away to say El is expected to save the day. It’s also fair to warn there’s a cliffhanger ending – we don’t know get to learn the precise fate for El and Orion here.\nOverall, once again, there’s a lot of fun to be had here in our characters’ struggle against the malevolent school, although this still doesn’t feel a very likely world. Our information as to what is really it is going on ‘outside’ has been limited to dialogue with incoming freshman hinting at something very ominous. At two-thirds of the way through the trilogy, it does feel a bit late in the day to only now start exploring the ‘real’ goings on and dark prophecies that have been fed as titbits throughout both books.\nAs good as the writing in it is, I’m hoping we’ll get start to get insight that actually moves the story on beyond heroes versus monsters early in the next book.\nThe Golden Enclaves (The Scholomance, #3)  4 stars out of 5    Publisher: Penguin Books Copyright year: 2022 ISBN: 978-1-529-15799-4  Graduated school, but the work continues  This final book of the Scholomance trilogy starts as our heroine, the wizard El (now about 18), is plunged back into an isolated present-day Welsh commune. There she has to deal with her grief at being forced to see her boyfriend Orion left to an eternity of being eaten by a beast known as a maw mouth and uncertainty that she will after all fulfil the prophecy that she will turn in an evil ‘malcifer’ witch.\nIt’s not long before El is called, somewhat bitterly and begrudgingly, to use her exceptional abilities to help rescue enclaves, the residences of extremely privileged wizards.\nDuring these escapades, El teams up with the academically minded Leisel, now also an ‘enclaver’, and together with one of El’s friends from the previous books they work to discover Orion’s fate. [Aside: there’s a physical relationship between El and Leisel here – I didn’t find this at all a problem, the explanations feel realistic for the characters experience.]\nI was a bit frustrated at the end of book 2 that, because the location of the books were cut off from the outside world, we really couldn’t progress at working out what the menace targeting the enclaves was. Well rest assured, there’s a twist as we learn the enclavers’ malevolent secrets and watch our characters struggle against those determined to hang onto power at whatever cost.\nIn fact, an underlying theme here is just not the advantages of privilege, but the lesson of just how evils in society can be perpetuated by justifying actions as a lesser evil. There’s also some really interesting descriptions of the joys and burdens of family and friendships, especially across cultures.\nThe book has sections set everywhere from London, Mumbai and New York, to Dubai and Beijing, meaning there’s a lot of international travel between the action. These sections suffer from some uneven pacing (a flight to New York is described in intricate detail, which jars against a section of travel from Portugal to Wales that just passes in an ‘El was distracted and didn’t remember it’). [Aside: as a young adult book, I’d have liked to think our characters would have been a bit more concerned about just roaming around the world via long-haul flights too.]\nThe other main negative is that you can definitely pull holes in the magic – not everything said about how it works is consistent with the final resolutions (it’s nearly there but not quite).\nThat said, the twists, the struggles and the outcome provide a satisfying conclusion to this coming-of-age story. I’m mostly going to remember the character of El, she remained somewhat annoyingly angsty to the end, but she sure knew how to pull off a big fight, whether that was against evil monsters or the more-complicated enemy – people.\n The Prince of Nothing trilogy by R. Scott Bakker An epic fantasy trilogy that is very dark even though it was written before the grimdark explosion. We follow the tale of three people who are instrumental in a Holy War reminiscent of The Crusades; one sorcerer (Achamian), one barbarian warrior (Cnaiür) and a monk (Kellhus) who’s trained in being able to perform miraculous feats of psychological manipulation.\nThe trilogy is the first part of the a seven-book series \u0026lsquo;The Second Apocalypse\u0026rsquo;, which continues in the four-book series \u0026lsquo;The Aspect-Emperor\u0026rsquo;.\nThe Darkness That Comes Before (The Prince of Nothing, #1)  5 stars out of 5    Publisher: Hachette Digital Copyright year: 2003 ISBN: 978-0-74812-013-0  What a world  We’re literally dropped right into an amazingly developed world that has so many religions, philosophies and political factions, and it’s difficult to get through the first chapters as there’s no exposition at all – I even had to find a version of the map online with dates on because it hangs together better if you at least follow the locations of the places referred to.\nBut if you persevere, there’s so much reward. Sure it’s dense and intense, especially with the very hefty doses of philosophy that our characters indulge in.\nI find it remarkable that the world is assembled in a way where philosophies and cultures that are diametrically opposed can make sense together.\nThere isn’t really any complexity to the plot, this first book is just about the political machinations involved in the instigation (yes–no) of Holy War, but I always enjoy political fantasy.\nOur three main characters are well realised but none of them are at all likeable, two of them are absolutely sociopaths. The sorcerer (Achamian) is the most interesting – he’s trying to find his place in the world but, partly because he’s being tortured by dreams of an apocalyptic past event, has a difficult path.\nHowever, saying it’s weaker when it comes women characters doesn’t come close. There’s only three women characters of any note, and despite it being a facet of setting, it would have been so much stronger if the book could have any women that weren’t just the whores that every male character denigrates them as.\nI suspect the author just can’t write women.\nThe Warrior Prophet (The Prince of Nothing, #2)  2 stars out of 5    Publisher: Hachette Digital Copyright year: 2004 ISBN: 978-0-74812-014-7  Struggling on in the war march  After setting up such an amazing world, I struggled with this sequel.\nThe book this time focuses on the development of Kellhus, the warrior-prophet of the title, as he continues to exert his manipulative control on the Holy War. I mostly enjoyed his sections, and found the theology and philosophy interesting. Sadly, everyone else is just far too superficial, even more so when we lose much of the mage Achamian as a countering character.\nAs we march across the continent lurching from battle to battle, anything which is fresh and pithy, and properly grim (there’s an excellent section on finding water), becomes ploughing on through a repetition of the same again and again, so there’s little that really advances the plot or keeps us immersed in the horror, it’s just the killing off another 30% of one or another army. I just seemed to be skimming a lot of text to get to each victory/defeat and another hundred miles or so closer to the destination town!\nI’m truly hoping we finally get some of the over-arching political dimensions of the world back in the final book.\nThe Thousandfold Thought (The Prince of Nothing, #3)  2.5 stars out of 5    Publisher: Hachette Digital Copyright year: 2006 ISBN: 978-0-74812-015-4  Better, especially in the final third, but too bleak for too little plot  With me very much liking the first book and very much not liking the second, as I started this, I was already feeling skeptical about the series.\nWell, overall, although this book was better than the second, there’s not enough for an redemption.\nWith the first book focussing on the political machinations before the Holy War, and the second trudging though the war itself, here it’s mostly philosophy and metaphysics. Although I do like some of this, even when it makes for hard reading, there’s only so much dense pondering I can take when we still don’t get any further on with the plot.\nFor the first two-thirds, everyone is continually just fawning over the main character and how great they are, when really, as the reader, we only see a sociopathic and misogynic mad man. It’s stupid to think others couldn’t see that at all, especially as magic isn’t invoked as an explanation.\nThen, when we near the final third, and the confrontation that’s been built up for most of three long books, everything is abrupt and rushed.\nThat said, some individual events and the extra world building is all quite fascinating, really fleshing out and broadening what already was an amazing and truly epic setting spanning continents and cultures.\nThe highlight was the overall climax for the sorcerer Achamian, which also marks the culmination of the book (all the half page of it) – it’s brave, and not an easy out for the author or the characters. This brought about true closure and opened up intriguing new possibilities.\nDespite me generally being a completionist when it comes to fantasy series, and indeed I’m reluctant to not find out where we go with the next four-book series to actually learn the full story of the second apocalypse, at the moment, I can’t face all the skimming over all grandiose prose I’d no doubt have.\nI am impressed with Bakker’s fresh thinking behind basing a fantasy on philosophy and psychology, but there’s simply no point of visiting somewhere so bleak for so little plot.\n Emily Wilde\u0026rsquo;s Encyclopaedia of Faeries by Heather Fawcett (Emily Wilde, #1)  4 stars out of 5    Publisher: Orbit Copyright year: 2023 ISBN: 978-0-356-51911-1  Fae and frolics – a slow-pace romance fantasy  Emily Wilde is a scholar from a 19th century Cambridge (UK), but in a world where the Fae are elusive but very much accepted as real. While continuing her work to complete the Encyclopedia of Faeries of the title, she travels to investigate the Fae of Scandinavia, and we follow her tale through her journal entries.\nWhat’s clever is an unusual and sensitive portray of Emily, who we see finally able to overcome some social ineptitude and start a slow-burning romance with her dashing academic rival and Cambridge colleague, Wendell, who of course has a mysterious background.\nMy favourite parts were the Fae stories themselves (including the interludes outside the plot – literal stories within the story presented as journal footnotes); there’s nothing particularly new there, everything is very traditional folklore – it’s just very well done. What does jar is that the author clearly has no idea of Cambridge academia (tenure is a concept that is neither Cambridge nor period), although we don’t spend too much time in that setting for it to be the problem it could be. For an expert on the Fae, Emily does also find herself trapped and take odd actions just a little too easily.\nA lighter read, but with some memorable darkness and some humour, but not enough for me to instantly want to buy the sequel.\n Death and Relaxation by Devon Monk (Ordinary Magic, #1)  3 stars out of 5    Publisher: OddHouse Press Copyright year: 2016 ISBN: 978-1-93985-302-8  Death is on holiday, but implausibility everywhere else  A light quick read set in the small American coastal town of Ordinary, a town that acts as the residence of vacationing gods. Because they are on vacation, the gods we meet cannot use their powers and they, although not their powers, can die. Among the few human mortals that are in on the town’s secrets, are the three sisters of the Reed family who form the real-life police department, with the chief, Delany Reed, being our main character.\nDelany’s duties include transferring the power of any gods who die while on vacation to a new person. Thus, when one of gods does die, we have a murder mystery (a little too mundane as we really don’t have much stake in the outcome) and a search for a new host for the god power (which irks because it’s supposedly urgent but is not treated as so by Delany until it’s critical urgent) taking place against the backdrop of the annual rhubarb festival (too stereotypically cutesy, especially with the time devoted to explaining again and again that Delany dislikes rhubarb).\nThe rest of the story involves a romance with a childhood sweetheart who is obviously not quite who he seems (not resolved here), and that’s actually handled nicely (there’s only one intimate scene) if with naive mooning that doesn’t quite fit the character; this has just the right amount of mystery to get invested. Then there are fun interludes with Death, newly on vacation, providing humour; it’s actually perfectly credible that Death would wear tourist t-shirts, always get served an over-the-top drink etc. etc.\nThere are faults aplenty – not just those mentioned above, but also a serious injury that is flippantly resolved by just getting up out the hospital and saying ouch a few times – however, as the first in nine-book series, I’d still give the benefit of doubt to see where it goes, but not if paying a lot for the sequel.\n Scales and Sensibility by Stephanie Burgis (Regency Dragons, #1)  4 stars out of 5    Publisher: Five Fathoms Press Copyright year: 2021 ISBN: 979-8-45071-769-2  Delightful little rom-com  A regency romp of a story as our heroine tries to save herself from the actions of horrid relatives she’s beholden to, with the help (or hindrance) of a magical dragon she befriends. I’d like to see where the series goes and for it to get a little more unexpected, as long as we still have a happily ever after ending.\nBut for now a perfect thing for a lighter read with a coffee and some cake on a Sunday afternoon - especially one where I’m exhausted after more marathon training ☺️.\nWas well worth buying.\n Legacy of Light by Matthew Ward (The Legacy Trilogy, #3)  3 stars out of 5    Publisher: Orbit Copyright year: 2023 ISBN: 978-0-356-51345-4  Too many last-minute rescues for me  Last in this epic fantasy trilogy here, but somehow I ended up not quite feeling it, struggling through chapter by chapter, and I’m not quite sure why.\nThe world is quite fascinating, and I liked the writing, with the main plot being driven by a struggle against someone who is slowly being corrupted by power. I think the issue is there always a twist to every battle, and it is very battle heavy, as the last-minute rescuers (including gods and the previously dead) ride in, and it gets messy with too many characters and points of view.\nIt might feel better on a re-read when you don’t have to focus on remembering the complexity.\n The Green Man\u0026rsquo;s Quarry by Juliet E. McKenna (Green Man, #6)  5 stars out of 5    Publisher: Wizard\u0026rsquo;s Tower Press Copyright year: 2023 ISBN: 978-1-91389-263-0  Another absorbing visit to a folklore-inspired Britain  It went on sale, I bought it, and then I stayed up late reading it, once again caught up in the author’s excellent storycraft.\nSome of what appeals to a British reader is the evocations of the UK countryside and travel that ring true – even to the point of visits to service stations - but what takes these books to excellent is the complexity of the main character, Dan. Once again, here we have him called in by the Green Man to solve a problem that requires his ‘foot in both worlds’ abilities as a human son of a dryad, abilities that mean he can see and interact with the naiads, slyphs, selkies, hobs etc. that appear throughout.\nSometimes we get a great helping of his naivety (of course the big cat isn’t really literally a big cat), other times we him have try to hold his own against a pub full of adversaries with careful words, and then again he also plays a hard man that it’s clear he’s not – yet it works.\nThere is a more obviously vicious human-led threat running through the book than we have seen before, when we mostly had evil folklore creatures, and the moralities involved are also more complex.\nThis perhaps makes for grittier reading but these are absolutely not dark or heavy books; it’s not a spoiler to say all gets resolved in the end. The book is self contained but with a few threads left dangling, perhaps to get picked up in a future episode. I’ll definitely be buying it.\n The Sword Defiant by Gareth Hanrahan (Lands of the Firstborn, #1)  3 stars out of 5    Publisher: Orbit Copyright year: 2023 ISBN: 978-0-356-51652-3  When a malicious sword is the best character  A past hero sets out on quest to investigate a warning of doom and finds judging who and what’s the evil to fight isn’t as easy as it was 20 years ago.\nThe trouble is, not the writing exactly, but that the whole thing doesn’t get going, as we flit around visiting another DnD-inspired character in another location but never with enough time/detail to get any answers. The only exception is rather boring interludes as the main character’s sister seeks to rescue her son from danger. Only just finished the book, and all I really remember enjoying is the malevolent talking sword, with even that not injecting the humour or drama it could because it’s too often just told to ‘shut up’. The world does have potential as we learn of hints of more-interesting political ramifications near the end, but it just didn’t do it here.\nIt is possible the second book improves now we have set up the scene, but I wouldn’t buy it straight off.\n The Hanging City by Charlie N. Holmberg  4.5 stars out of 5    Publisher: 47North Copyright year: 2023 ISBN: 978-1-662-50871-4  A city-building fantasy romance  Coming from only having read the Whimbrel House series from this author before, I was surprised to find this set in a world with non-human characters.\nAlthough at heart this book is a romance, much centres on, if not world-building, at least city building – the hanging city of the title is imaginative, and you feel its solidity right from the diagram at the start of the book. This is the city of the trolls, built down into a crevasse with careful engineering beneath an ‘old world’ bridge. It shelters the trolls from a harsh drought-ridden earth above but also situates them near constant danger from monsters. The trolls themselves are presented with just enough detail to make you believe in the reality of their caste system, which cleverly is not entire martial, and to also see those we meet as individuals.\nOur human heroine and story teller, Lark, enters the city as a refugee seven years after fleeing from an abusive father and in search of somewhere she can belong, clinging to a fortune told to her years early. Lark too, is well thought out; her unique ability, to instil fear, is used effectively and is the main driver of the story as she falls in love with a troll and inevitably has to prove her loyalty both to her love and to the trolls in general.\nWe have satisfactory pacing and an ending that is believable rather than saccharine.\n4.5 stars, only not reaching excellent because it’s a bit light. (Perhaps this author’s special talent is the life she gives to buildings, and that at least is not so different from the house of Whimbrel House after all).\n Legends \u0026amp; Lattes by Travis Baldree (Legends \u0026amp; Lattes, #1)  4.5 stars out of 5    Publisher: Tor Copyright year: 2022 ISBN: 978-1-035-00733-2  Needing an ‘extra shot’ to get beyond good  I came to this book knowing that it is described as ‘cosy fantasy’ and there’d be few surprises. I didn’t know what cosy fantasy is but do now.\nHere, we have light-hearted, but not sexual, romance embedded in a fun slice of life story about Viv, an orc, opening a café (complete with a cook to make cinnamon buns and biscotti) perhaps, or perhaps not, with a little magical help.\nThe other characters comprise those enlisted to help in the cafe endeavour, as well as a few rogues and the members of DnD-style adventurers’ troupe that Viv previously belonged to. The trouble is there’s just not much here world- or character-building wise, and the book itself is very short. The only person we really learn anything about is Viv, and apart from a few references to height and strength, she might as well be human. One to enjoy on a commute but could only recommend buying if you get a really heavy discount off list price, which thankfully I did.\nThat said, 4.5 stars (the extra half is for the descriptions of the baking).\n[Note from the future: I\u0026rsquo;ve since read another couple of books denoted \u0026lsquo;cosy fantasy\u0026rsquo; and can see why this is rated so highly within this genre.]\n The First Binding by R. R. Virdi (Tales of Tremaine, #1)  4 stars out of 5    Publisher: Gollancz Copyright year: 2022 ISBN: 978-1-473-23401-7  Rothfuss inspired but not bad for that  At 10% of the way through:\nBefore having looked at other reviews, I was a bit ummmm…. perhaps a little over-inspired by Rothfuss (which I read back when it came out and can hardly remember).\nThe main character’s overblown prose is somewhat irritating, but still not sure how much that’s deliberate as opposed to the writer’s style – it’s clever if the former. Only just getting going with the ‘back story’, so next need to see how that works in. It’s a long book… lots to go!\nWhen finished:\nMuch better after the back story starts; still weakest when it strays into fan fiction – we have several more scenes that even I spot as Rothfuss rewrites. Overwrought prose will pull you out of the story at times, but we do have a remarkable world, strong characters and some wicked twists as baddies are revealed. I quite like its slow-burner pacing, and excellent portrayal of the value vs costs of things.\nCliffhanger ending. I’ll read the next one.\n This Is How You Lose the Time War by Max Gladstone  3 stars out of 5    Publisher: Jo Fletcher Books Copyright year: 2019 ISBN: 978-1-52940-524-8  Love letters meets time travel  Worth reading but I wasn’t up on all the literary references as much as you need to be.\nThe quality of the writing was obvious and superb, but, oddly for a novella, I felt it a little too long.\nI wanted the story to move on from the love letter correspondence between Red and Blue one or two letters earlier. The immersion that was achieved for the diverse locations with such brief descriptions was my highlight.\nThere’s a mystery character appearing at the end of each letter, and although readers (esp. any fantasy/SF reader) would spot who that is, when we actually meet them, for the end game, I got more into the romance of it.\n Extra shots  An enjoyable SF\u0026amp;F book review blog\nhttps://www.runalongtheshelves.net/ Do your own pattern reading as per the \u0026lsquo;Rook and Rose\u0026rsquo; trilogy\nhttps://www.macarrick.com/pattern/  ","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2025/01/book-reviews-2024/","summary":"Here, I\u0026rsquo;m bringing together all 19 book reviews I\u0026rsquo;ve written for fantasy books read in 2024, as originally published on my Bookwyrm account.

It was adapted from a plum jam recipe found in the book Jams \u0026amp; Chutneys: Preserving the harvest by Thane Prince (IBSN 978-1-4053-2954-5; I\u0026rsquo;d also recommend the orange and beetroot chutney recipe from this book) although the original recipe was for about half the quantity and gave the preparation time as an implausible 20 mins.\nThese damsons are \u0026lsquo;merryweather\u0026rsquo; variety, which are sweet enough to eat as fruit, although noticeably sharper than a typical Victoria plum.\nJam recipe Ingredients  2 kg damsons 2 kg sugar (we had 0.15 kg being brown sugar for flavour) 500 ml water 4 cm piece of ginger, peeled, sliced and pestled 1 star anise, ground a few pieces of cassia bark plus some ground cinnamon (maybe a teaspoon or two)  Method  Place jars in oven on low heat to sterilise.\nMeanwhile\u0026hellip; Cut the damsons in half and remove the stones. Double check no stones got thrown in with the fruit. Put all ingredients in a large preserving pan.   Bring to the boil (takes maybe 15 mins or more). Reduce on a moderate/high heat (rolling boil) until it reaches a temperature of 105°C measured with an electronic probe. This took about 30 or 35 mins. I also tried the wrinkle test (put some jam on a cold plate and push it to see if it flows or wrinkles) and saw slight wrinkling. Turn off the heat and ladle the jam into the sterilised jars using a funnel. This made about 2.5 l of jam, which set overnight.   Given that plums and damsons have a relatively high pectin content, I was worried about over setting (which can lead to the formation of a plum \u0026lsquo;cheese\u0026rsquo; instead of a jam). On the other hand, I was also worried that a lengthy boil might have degraded the pectin, but it seems to have worked well.\n Taste test of a left over amount of jam with cream on scones (scones made as per the previous post) was favourable.\nCrumble Of course, another great autumn dish is to use up fruit by making crumbles; a crumble topping is very tolerant of ingredient proportions but, as the crumb, I use:\n 100 g sugar 100 g butter 150 g plain flour  Then add:\n 100 g jumbo oats 30 g chopped pecan nuts   Extra shots  Damson cobbler recipe\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/damsoncobbler_70309 A resource for all things preserving\nhttps://nchfp.uga.edu/  ","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2024/09/damson-jam/","summary":"Our damson tree had an unusually large crop of fruit this year, so I decided to make a batch of jam.

Once you get there you\u0026rsquo;ve got to go up it!\n  On reaching the Glen Nevis campsite and checking in, I took one of the Ben Nevis Safety Information leaflets that were available at the campsite reception.\nThis did little to allay my worries (stoked by the descriptions in the guide book and on the internet), although I was heartened that the leaflet referred to it as a walk rather than a climb.\nBen Nevis is ascended by many people (~150,000) every year, but it\u0026rsquo;s not to be taken too lightly as the 1344 m height (and you start at pretty much sea level) mean it\u0026rsquo;s a fair way up (being the tallest peak in the UK) and the weather can be changeable; regardless of the conditions at the bottom, the summit can often be in cloud and a lot colder than in the valley below.\n...in the unlikely event I needed rescue, camouflage would be unfortunate!  Looking through the leaflet\u0026rsquo;s checklist , I saw that I had everything apart from a \u0026lsquo;Survival bag/emergency shelter\u0026rsquo; (waterproofs and warm cloths – check!, map – check!, compass – check!, head torch – check! etc.; none of the suggested items were what I imagined mountaineers might have, such as ropes, ice axes, oxygen tanks\u0026hellip;). I briefly considered taking my bivvy bag with me but wasn\u0026rsquo;t keen on the extra weight nor the idea that, in the unlikely event I needed rescue, camouflage would be unfortunate!\nBrowsing the campsite shop, I was able to find a foil survival bag that I decided I needed.\n The lower slopes of Glen Nevis.\n  I set off from the visitor center, after pausing only for a last toilet stop and to buy a small waterproof map to remove my worry about \u0026lsquo;what if I\u0026rsquo;m lost on the mountain in the rain and my regular OS map dissolves and my phone has no reception\u0026rsquo; (at £4:50 I think the shop saw me coming!).\nI was certainly going to be following the most well-trodden mountain path (aka the \u0026lsquo;tourist path\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;pony track\u0026rsquo;), although I understand there are other options for the more adventurous. Seeing the number of people starting off on this path (it was a steady stream), I was already feeling more confident.\nThe fact my rucksack was the best part of 10 kg lighter than for the previous days also put me in a buoyant mood.\n The path just below the clouds.\n  The early part of the climb up the valley was hard work, and I soon decided that I was too sweaty to keep my waterproofs on – I was going to be quite damp either way so took them off and continued in my long-sleeve top and hiking trousers despite the occasional bouts of rain and mist.\nThe temperature gradually cooled as I progressed up the mountain, past the halfway lochan and on to the zig-zagging path beyond. Shortly after the lochan, the path reached the level of the clouds, which manifested as a thick fog.\n Cairns marking the path to the summit.\n  This would have been quite disconcerting apart from the obvious nature of the path and the number of walkers making it feel hard to get lost.\nNevertheless, it was starting to feel more like a proper mountain.\nReaching the plateau near the summit, the weather took another turn with the wind picking up enough that I felt I needed to be very careful to stay back from any drops that the path passed.\nBy this point, the visibility was also low enough that you could barely see from one of the large cairns that marked the path to the next.\n The trig point and shelter at the summit.\n  To further emphasise the contrast, there were still banks of snow remaining at one or two points. I was glad there were plenty of other people around – I felt it could have been a bit eerie on your own and I could see how it would be a very different experience in winter when snow would obscure the path.\nBy now, all my warm clothes were back on, and I was again glad of the bobble hat, although other more-hardy individuals seemed to also be fine with more casual wear; one person even seemed OK with a short-sleeved Newcastle United top.\n Admiring the \u0026lsquo;view\u0026rsquo; at the top.\n  The summit itself has plenty to see regardless of the clouds obscuring the views.\nAs well as the trig point, there is an emergency shelter adorned with stickers and Himalayan style prayer flags, a war memorial and the stone walls of some ruined buildings.\nAs I stopped for a break in the shelter of some of the ruins, I was joined briefly by a semi-tame Snow Bunting, which I\u0026rsquo;m sure had realised the top of Ben Nevis is a great place for picking up crumbs. Adding to the mountain vibe was a group of people who were taking a break from the wind in their orange mountaineering shelter.\n Getting back beneath the cloud.\n  As I went back down – it took ~3 h to reach the top, and then roughly the same time to descend – the cloud started to lift and there were some great views over towards Fort William and the channel beyond, as well as some spectacular scenery formed by the mountain itself.\n A waterfall near the path.\n  By the time I\u0026rsquo;d got back to the campsite (and its pub), the cloud had completely lifted for a rare moment, and I was able to look back to see the mountain top.\n View of Ben Nevis (now free of cloud) from the campsite.\n  Train home  Another photo of the Man with Sore Feet, this time actually showing the feet.\n  There are a few trains per day from Fort William back to Glasgow, but I needed an early one to complete the journey back to Letchworth in a day.\nHaving bought my ticket already, I\u0026rsquo;d set an alarm to be sure to get to the station for the 07:44 train, but it turned out to be unnecessary as I was woken with a shock at 5 am anyway when I felt something walk over my legs!\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what it was, but am guessing some kind of rodent, so I like to think a squirrel. That certainly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t happen with a tent, so I can say that the bivvy bag does indeed bring you closer to nature!\nWith the extra time to kill in Fort William, I had time for a diversion back to take some more pictures of the Man with Sore Feet and also pick up some snacks for the journey.\nThe train line from Fort William to Glasgow is more scenic than fast. It more or less retraces the journey of the WHW, although it takes a different route out of Fort William and over Rannoch Moor, and runs on the west side of Loch Lomond.\nThe line, which is a single track in most places, winds through the hills, and the diesel locomotive of the train seemed to have to take the various bends and inclines at a very sedate pace.\n View from the train window as it passes alongside a gorge.\n  The ~100 miles is timetabled to take ~4 h, and I think it could be recommended as an excursion from Glasgow for its own sake. You see much of the spectacular scenery from the relative comfort of the train! We had the sight of several herds of deer as the train passed over the moors.\nUnfortunately for my journey, the train developed a fault and, after some stop–start on the way, it was decided that it couldn\u0026rsquo;t continue and we had to disembark at Garelochhead where we waited for a replacement.\n All change at Garelochhead. The faulty train is in the siding to the left as the next service to Glasgow arrives.\n  All told, this added something over an hour delay to the journey by the time we arrived in Glasgow.\nThe rest of the journey went relatively smoothly, taking the route via Edinburgh and the East Coast Mainline on much faster trains.\nThere were still plenty of sights to see as you followed the coast of Scotland and Northumberland before heading on to Newcastle, York and eventually back to Stevenage, where I changed to catch one of the familiar commuter trains for the short hop back to Letchworth.\nIn summary Looking back on this trip, I do feel it what I was hoping for in terms of being a good adventure without too much real risk/worry if anything had gone wrong. Compared to other less-beaten paths, there were a reassuring number options to pick up anything you needed, up to and including a train home, if it all got too much. The trade-off was that it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel quite so wild – there were generally other people around. Not that I felt that fully a bad thing.\nTo take full advantage of the flexibility offered by wild camping, it might be possible to stop at less-obvious locations, perhaps starting with a shorter day to put you out of sync with other hikers. That could make for a different experience, although you\u0026rsquo;d need to take a bit more care about the weather if camping in more remote spots.\n...there were only so many meals of flapjack and noodles that I'd want on a longer schedule  The approach of travelling relatively light worked well for me, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really find anything I missed (see my preparation post). That said, I relied strongly on being able to complete the route in relatively few days. The shorter itinerary you plan, the more it seems OK to leave a few comforts behind to save weight.\nI definitely felt there were only so many meals of flapjack and cold noodles (!) that I\u0026rsquo;d want on a longer schedule, and I\u0026rsquo;d also have been feeling the need either to take more clean clothes or spend more time washing the ones I had.\nIt also struck me that those travelling slower would, if anything, need to carry more water at any given stage to see them to the next refill point.\nI was a bit lucky with the weather. Although there was some rain, I could have had a lot less fun if it had been heavier or more continuous. As it was, the bivvy bag worked well, but a tent (or hotel/hostel or baggage transfer) could have been better at other times of year (I\u0026rsquo;ve heard stories of tents covered with frost in May). Likewise, I felt I had quite a mild brush with the midges.\n...wild camping seems to be generally allowed within the national parks of Ireland.  Maybe because of the expectations set by blogs and guidebooks on the number of days to take, or maybe because there were plenty of people going the same way (and maybe because it did coincide with an actual race), I did feel like at times I was pushing myself to go a bit further each day. It could also have been good to have time to explore more of the sights off the trail and soak in the views.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if/when I might get a chance to do anything similar again, but if I did I\u0026rsquo;d be tempted to look at some of the less-frequented footpaths in the highlands (I have been browsing my barely used OS maps of the area). I also note that wild camping seems to be generally allowed within the national parks of Ireland.\nImage gallery                                     Extra shots  Older Ben Nevis walking maps\nhttps://heavywhalley.wordpress.com/2024/08/20/diagrams-of-climbing-info-before-modern-technology/ Blog where they\u0026rsquo;ve taken the sleeper train to Fort William\nhttps://dom.blog/2023/08/fort-william/ Blog on dos and don\u0026rsquo;ts of Ben Nevis\nhttps://www.alongdustyroads.com/posts/climbing-ben-nevis   Credits The map is sourced from OpenStreetMaps, licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF).\nMap traces were plotted using GPX studio (MIT license).\n","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2024/08/west-highland-way-iv/","summary":"Having reached Fort William in 5 days, I was definitely hoping to climb Ben Nevis but was a bit unsure whether it would be a good idea after the days spent hiking.

The 5 days from Milngavie to Fort William - we now have the last two sections to go.\n  For anyone preferring to read in installments, here are some links to each section:\n Day 5: Kinlochleven to Fort William Image gallery of some photos that didn\u0026rsquo;t make the main post  Bridge of Orchy to nr Kinlochleven (day 4)  Today\u0026rsquo;s distance: 19.9 miles/32.0 km\n Elevation gain: 1006 m\n Time walking: 7 h 36 min\n Distance to date: 84.7 miles/136.3 km  After a good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep, a 7 am start meant I was greeted by a beautiful view over the River Orchy as the sun rose over the hills beyond.\n Looking east over the River Orchy towards the Grampian mountains.\n  I packed up my camping kit and was shortly on my way. The trail from Bridge of Orchy to Inveroran isn\u0026rsquo;t long (~4 km), but there is quite a steep ascent and decent up and back down Mam Carraigh (361 m) to negotiate before you get there.\nThere were already a few others on the route, and by the time I reached the peak, a group ahead of me was stopping to admire the view, so I took the opportunity to ask them to grab a photo.\n Mam Carraigh and Loch Tulla.\n  There isn\u0026rsquo;t a lot at Inveroran apart from the hotel. At that time in the morning, it was shut to visitors, but the attached shop was able to order (via walkie talkie!) breakfast items from their kitchen.\nI had a morning roll with bacon, potato scone and black pudding. Then, given that that had been great, and I knew I might have a way to go before reaching civilisation again, I had another one!\n A trail runner, probably part of the race, on the WHW near Rannoch Moor.\n  While munching on these, I got a shock as the first runners from the West Highland Way race passed. I knew this ultra-marathon was happening, and had expected to see some of the 200 or so competitors as the Saturday went on, but I hadn\u0026rsquo;t registered that the race had started at 1 am nor that the front-runners would be so quick as to be past the halfway point before breakfast!\nAfter leaving Inveroran, after an initial climb up the cobbled old drove road, the going levelled off as the path reached the open peat expanse of the Rannoch Moor wilderness.\nThe landscape here is really quite distinct from other parts of the WHW, being an open plateau criss-crossed with streams and dotted with small ponds and lakes.\nAt one point the path bridged a small stream and there were trout swimming gently to hold station in the water below. You can also see the path unfolding for miles ahead of you with its procession of hikers stretching into the distance.\n...the showers [were] a bargain at £1  Towards the end of the moor, you have another climb, and then the path drops towards the Glencoe Mountain Resort (it has chair lifts running in summer as well as in ski season for those that fancy that) and then, a little further on, to Kingshouse hotel.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t take any food at Kingshouse hotel itself, having already stopped for a rest and a snack while watching the gradually increasing number of ultra-marathon competitors running past. However, I did make good use of the public toilets and showers (a bargain at £1 for a warm shower).\nRested, and now wearing my cleaner clothes, I decided to press on towards Kinlochleven.\n Stob Dearg of Buachaille Etive Mòr.\n  Not long after, at the junction of Glen Coe and Glen Etive, you come across one of the most-photographed sites in Scotland (not only from the WHW but also from the A82!); the perfectly pyramid-shaped (from the right angle and assuming no cloud) rocky mountain that lies at the north end of the Buachaille Etive Mor ridge, Stob Dearg, also often pictured with the white-washed Lagangarbh Cottage (or just the \u0026lsquo;Wee White House\u0026rsquo; if you prefer) that sits at its base.\n The sign marking the start of The Devil\u0026rsquo;s Staircase.\n  This marks the end of a few relatively easy kilometers along the Old Military Road, as you find yourself at the base of the terrifyingly named \u0026lsquo;Devil\u0026rsquo;s Staircase\u0026rsquo;, marked with a sign.\nDespite the idea that the ascent might be of dizzying difficulty, it\u0026rsquo;s actually fairly accessible.\nThe \u0026lsquo;devil\u0026rsquo; of the name here is actually a reference to the hardships faced by the workmen (\u0026lsquo;navvies\u0026rsquo;) who built and maintained this zigzag road in the 18th and 19th centuries, which resulted in numerous deaths [the staircase was the way to the only pub for 20 miles (at Kingshouse) but you needed to be wary of the devil snaring you during your traverse over the hills on the way back after one too many a pint].\nI made it to the highest point of the WHW  That said, the path is still certainly steep (it looked quite exhilarating for some mountain bikers that were coming down), but after a certain amount of stopping to admire the view and catch my breath, I made it to the highest point of the WHW (550 m).\nLeft to my own devices, I\u0026rsquo;d have almost certainly continued straight on towards Kinlochleven. However, as I got to the top, which sits at a saddle between two hills, I saw a group of people milling around as the last few of their party were returning from the summit of Stob Mhic Mhartuin (716 m) to my left.\n At the top of the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Staircase in Glencoe with Buachaille Etive Mòr forming the ridge on the right.\n  Chatting to the leader of the group (it turned out it was a school party and he was a teacher), he convinced me the view was worth the detour. I enquired how tough the steps and bog were, and he said something to the effect of \u0026ldquo;looks like you have some suitable boots, it should be fine\u0026rdquo;. I felt the conversation might have gone differently but for the boots I\u0026rsquo;d bought the day before!\nI was tempted to leave my rucksack for my return, but decided against it (\u0026lsquo;what if I get stuck on the hill and need something from it\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;what if I can\u0026rsquo;t find the rucksack when I get back\u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip;).\nAfter what seemed not too bad a climb (no hands or knees required, it was indeed more of a \u0026lsquo;strolling mountain\u0026rsquo; than a \u0026lsquo;mountaineering mountain\u0026rsquo;), I found myself at the top, and was glad I had taken everything, particularly the thicker fleece, waterproof and even the bobble hat, as it was rather more windy at the summit than back on the WHW. I spent a little time exploring the amazing viewpoints over Glen Coe (there are several marked with cairns).\nI did not want be taken by the devil myself  If anything, going back down was harder than going up, and care was needed not to get carried away on the loose and slippery rocks and bog. I was happy that the clouds held up sufficiently that I could keep the path back down in easy sight (I did not want be taken by the devil myself).\nAll told, the diversion meant it was 6 pm before I was back continuing on the WHW and my legs were tired from climbing. After a couple more kilometers, I could see I was approaching a winding, and possibly steep, descent to Kinlochleven, so I decided to camp for the night.\n My camping spot on the hill above Kinlochleven.\n  I soon came across what looked like an ideal spot marked by a cairn [in fact, there was a pile of rocks by most features of interest on this part of the WHW], although it wasn\u0026rsquo;t what I\u0026rsquo;d been expecting.\nA rectangular area of very smooth rock showed through the heather and grass. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether this feature was natural but guess that the vegetation might have been scraped away at some point. Regardless, it looked like it could be weirdly comfortable. There was only a slight slope to the rock, and an undulation to the surface formed a slight dip, reminiscent of the shape a mattress might make under the weight of your hips.\nAfter a quick test lying on my mat before committing to assembling the bivvy bag, it seemed OK, so I decided to go for it. The next challenge was how to peg down the bivvy bag on rock. Fortunately the cord that I\u0026rsquo;d bought to try to hold my boots together was useful at this point!\nThrough a combination of running lines to tent pegs in the surrounding grass and tying other lines to some rocks borrowed from the cairn, I managed to fix the bag in place.\nWhile I was doing this, and preparing my dinner (more cold soaked noodles, followed by flapjack), there was still a steady stream runners passing the spot, making it feel significantly less wild than I imagine it might on any other night of the year.\nI continued to be kept awake by the patter of runners' feet  I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure on the correct etiquette on cheering for such a race, but the supporters assured me that anything along the lines of \u0026ldquo;well done! keep going!\u0026rdquo; was appreciated.\nAs it started to get dark, I retired to sleep. However, I continued to be kept awake for some time by the patter of runners' feet. The spot I\u0026rsquo;d chosen was obviously the first point that the lights of Kinlochleven were visible, so there I overheard numerous conversations to the effect of \u0026ldquo;Is that Kinlochleven?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Yes, I think it\u0026rsquo;s Kinlochleven, we\u0026rsquo;re nearly there!\u0026rdquo;.\nThere was a little wind and rain in the night as well, but overall, once I did get to sleep, I slept pretty well, and by the next morning, the trail was deserted.\nKinlochleven to Fort William (day 5)  Today\u0026rsquo;s distance: 21.25 miles/34.2 km Elevation gain: 658 m Time walking: 8 h 02 min Distance to date: 105.9 miles/170.5 km (I can\u0026rsquo;t really account for all the ~15 km extra my GPS watch recorded over the 5 days compared to the official distance, despite detours and going wrong, but it does seem it adds up!)  After packing up, and leaving no trace by returning the stones I\u0026rsquo;d borrowed to the cairn, I continued down the trail towards Kinlochleven. As it turned out, the descent wasn\u0026rsquo;t what I\u0026rsquo;d feared, as the track soon became a wide dirt road, and I quickly reached the the hydroelectric plant (which once also ran an aluminum smelter) on the outskirts of the town.\n The hydroelectric aluminum plant at Kinlochleven.\n  At that time (8 am on a Sunday), it was pretty quiet, with the cafe shut. However, I was able to buy some breakfast pastries, orange juice and provisions for the day from the Co-op, and made use of the public toilets (which also had drinking water taps) before heading on to the final day of the WHW.\nFrom this point on, my route and schedule would be the same as that for almost all travelers of the WHW – hiking the remaining 15 miles to Fort William (there are no accommodation options in between). Or so I thought\u0026hellip;\n The town center of Kinlochleven, early on Sunday morning.\n  Although I\u0026rsquo;d been told it was pretty much impossible to get lost on the WHW (and it is very well signposted), I somehow managed to miss the turn off where it leaves the road exiting Kinlochleven and I took an unplanned diversion of a few hundred meters before realising I was not on the WHW.\n A sign I missed where the WHW leaves the road.\n  As I retraced my steps, I found the signpost I\u0026rsquo;d missed, rejoined the trail and headed up the hill. [If you are to do a detour here, a better plan is to go and visit the Grey Mare\u0026rsquo;s Tail waterfall, but I\u0026rsquo;ll have to save that for another time!]\nFor me, this last day of hiking and especially the few kilometers after the the climb up from Kinlochleven was perhaps the most spectacular of the whole trip. The trail follows the track of the Old Military Road along the valley (known as Lairigmor, or \u0026lsquo;big pass\u0026rsquo;) between steep mountainsides and there is no modern road to disturb the peace of the surroundings. The main signs of civilisation on this stretch are the occasional ruins of bygone cottages and sheep folds.\nVarious little streams descend the sides of the valley, and this was one point where I would have been confident to try the water purification tablets if I\u0026rsquo;d needed – the water certainly looked clear and fast flowing.\n The path passes the ruined cottage of Lairigmor.\n  With relatively easy walking after the previous days, the path continues along the valley for quite a way before reaching the Nevis Forest, which it winds its way through for the second half of the day.\nBy the time I was at the forest, the morning\u0026rsquo;s drizzle had cleared up and, with the sun now out, it was starting to get quite warm.\nI took the opportunity to dry my damp towel and top by attaching them to my backpack. By then, I was feeling somewhat paranoid about making sure these items didn\u0026rsquo;t touch any vegetation along the path as I\u0026rsquo;d been chatting to some dog walkers who\u0026rsquo;d been telling me of the the dozens of ticks (which as well as being unpleasant can spread Lyme\u0026rsquo;s disease) they\u0026rsquo;d had to remove from their dog after its carefree bounding through the heather.\n The path to the fort, with Ben Nevis in the background.\n  The path through the forest (which wasn\u0026rsquo;t as shady as I might have hoped) was a little tough in places, and I was starting to feel positively hot by the time I got my first view of the great Ben Nevis mountain and reached the turn off for the vitrified iron-age fort of Dùn Deardail.\n The view looking south east from the fort (Ben Nevis dominates the view ENE from here). The munro in the middle is Sgùrr a' Mhàim.\n  The fort is definitely worth the short diversion to see – the views from the top are great and it\u0026rsquo;s intriguing to think what circumstances might have led to the fort being burned so hot it vitrified the stones. The consensus seems to be that it would have been a deliberate act to destroy the fort, but many details are likely to never be known. It must have been an event to remember for whoever was there all those years ago.\n Sign marking \u0026lsquo;The original end of the West Highland Way\u0026rsquo;.\n  The path from the fort down to Glen Nevis was easy going, a gradually descending forestry road, and I soon found myself on the outskirts of Fort William, only feeling a little sad that my adventure was coming to an end already.\nI decided not to worry about accommodation until I had got to \u0026lsquo;the end\u0026rsquo; of the WHW. Reading the guidebook, I had the impression that there were many options, but now as I approached the town in the early evening I was starting to wonder, but among the \u0026lsquo;no vacancies\u0026rsquo; signs on the guesthouses, I did see one or two places that seemed to have spaces left.\nI walked on past the \u0026lsquo;old end of the West Highland Way\u0026rsquo; sign, past the train station and along the high street for what seemed a bit further than I was expecting.\n...apparently battered haggis is a standard of Scottish fish shops, or at least not unique to tourist areas!  I obviously had the look of \u0026lsquo;someone looking for the end of the WHW\u0026rsquo;, and as I did my last bit of hiking, I got talking to someone who had finished the ultra-marathon race the previous day and who assured me that it was \u0026ldquo;just a bit further, by the side of the Travelodge sign\u0026rdquo; that could be seen in the distance.\n The end of walk photo.\n  When I got to the statue at the end, I was slightly surprised. Although I recognised the \u0026lsquo;Man with Sore Feet\u0026rsquo; when I saw it (having seen it in passing in descriptions that I\u0026rsquo;d read), it hadn\u0026rsquo;t really registered with me as being the iconic statue marking the end of the WHW; I\u0026rsquo;d sort of been expecting a symmetrical obelisk to that at the start at this end too.\nI managed to get the obligatory photo 🎉!\nThen time to turn my thoughts the the increasingly pressing matters of what to do about food and accommodation for the night.\n Battered haggis and chips.\n  Having no luck getting through on the phone to the youth hostel or the campsite (there was another Euro\u0026rsquo;s match on with Scotland playing), I called the number of a guesthouse that I\u0026rsquo;d noted had vacancies.\nWhen it turned out that they really did have vacancies, I decided to take it, as the option of an actual bed, shower and breakfast all seemed very appealing at that point. [I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure it would also have been ok to just turn up at the campsite, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure of that and was not wanting any extra walking!].\nAfter checking in at the guesthouse, I made my way back into town to find some food.\n Irn Bru toast to the sunset.\n  It was getting a bit late by this point, but the fish and chip shop was still serving. When I went to order, I found they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any fish left and had stopped frying for the night.\nChecking the assorted savories that remained, I decided to go for the \u0026lsquo;battered chilli haggis\u0026rsquo;. [I\u0026rsquo;ve since learnt from one of my Scottish work colleagues that apparently battered haggis is a standard of Scottish fish shops, or at least not unique to tourist areas!]\nDespite not being the most visually appealing culinary delicacy I\u0026rsquo;ve had in Scotland, this was pretty darn good, if not very good for you!\nThis paired with a can of Irn Bru – the \u0026lsquo;classic\u0026rsquo; Scottish drink (not counting whisky) – was therefore both a win and a fitting end to the WHW, especially savoured on the sea front (Loch Linne) as the sun set.

It\u0026rsquo;s not hard to work out why – from loch-side views, to lush rainforest, wild moors, soaring highland mountains and back down to the sea, it takes in some of the best of Scotland\u0026rsquo;s scenery, yet is fairly accessible hiking with lots of supply stops available.\nApparently, some 40,000 people complete the entire walk each year, and I was soon to be one of them.\nI was setting off without a plan (see the previous post for my preparation), but it turned out it took me 5 days, although not without some hiccups (nothing serious) along the way. I\u0026rsquo;m very glad to have done it, and yes, this sort of adventure does get you away from the eternal computer screen.\n ©Open Street Maps. The 5 days from Milngavie to Fort William\n  For anyone preferring to read in installments, here are some links to each day\u0026rsquo;s adventure; days 4 and 5, and the hike up Ben Nevis, will follow in the next post:\n Day 1: Milngavie to Cashel Day 2: Cashel to nr Doune Byre Day 3: Doune Byre to Bridge of Orchy Image gallery of some photos that didn\u0026rsquo;t make the main post  Home to Milngavie Even on the morning I was due to depart, I was having some last-minute doubts about what I should take.\nDid I really need the flip-flops? How many oat bars would be too many? What about the 200 g of trail mix? Should I take the instant noodles?\nI had to cut short this dithering (deciding to take all the oat bars, just one of the packets of noodles and leave the trail mix) when, upon checking the live departures, I noticed my train had been cancelled. I really needed to hurry up to have time to catch an earlier train and still make my connection (my journey to Glasgow went via Finsbury Park, Euston and then up the West Coast Main Line to Glasgow Central).\nDid I really need the flip-flops?  I packed up the last items of kit, strapped my hiking poles to the side of my rucksack and headed briskly off to the station.\nAfter checking that, yes, it was fine to take the earlier train in this circumstance, there followed a relaxed trip to Euston and a wait there before catching my second train of the day for an uneventful journey to Glasgow (it only ran slightly late owing to signalling problems or some such). And there I was – in Glasgow – by late afternoon.\n Reaching Glasgow.\n  After a short look round the city centre and a break for dinner at a Mexican restaurant (cactus quesadillas, no tequila – what I imagined might be quite different to the food at cafes on the walk), I took my final train of the day from Glasgow Queen Street to Milngavie (the announcements did indeed pronounce it more like Mil-guy, as per what my guidebook had said).\n Glasgow City Chambers. The council building in George Square.\n  For my last night before heading into the relative wilderness, I had an actual bed as I was staying in an airbnb (a genuine spare room) in a house in Milngavie.\nLooking at the guest book there, almost everyone who had stayed was doing so as a prelude to the WHW, and it was striking from how far afield people had come. There had been plenty of guests from different corners of Europe and also much further afield.\nMilngavie to Cashel (day 1)  Today\u0026rsquo;s distance: 23.5 miles/37.8 km\n Elevation gain: 690 m\n Time walking: 8 h 07 min\n Distance to date: 23.5 miles/37.8 km  After eating some muesli kindly provided by my host, it was only a short walk to the obelisk that marks the start (or finish for those going north to south) of the WHW in Milngavie.\nWalking down the high street towards it, I felt a surprising sense of trepidation/excitement, similar to that you get before the start of a big running race. Maybe this sense of occasion was heightened by the preparations for a fun run, which included attaching bunting to the obelisk.\n The obligatory start photo!\n  I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only person who had chosen that time on a Wednesday morning to start their WHW adventure, but I only had a short wait for my turn for a photo with the obelisk.\nOn the first section of the path (known to be relatively easy going), I was very aware of how far I still had to go and was wanting to be cautious to resist any temptation to set off at a possibly literally blistering pace and take every opportunity for a rest.\nIndeed, at one point in the early part of the walk someone had installed a small sign pointing back towards the south with the words \u0026lsquo;The Shire\u0026rsquo; – this is in keeping with the easy terrain for the usual south to north direction for walking the WHW; very few people would actually want to start at Mount Doom!\nAlso, as this was mid-June, I figured I had many hours of daylight and there was no particular rush.\nAs I travelled over the rolling hills, I next stopped for a break at viewpoint over a lake (I think it was Craigallian Loch, only a few kilometres into the walk) and had a chat with another hiker.\nI got the impression that he spent a lot of time touring the footpaths of Scotland (and had apparently walked the WHW many a time).\nSomehow, everyone I met seemed to have done a lot more walking! At least I was heartened that my choice of backpack was recognised as \u0026ldquo;a bergen\u0026rdquo; and didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to to cause worry – \u0026ldquo;it is what it is\u0026rdquo; was the phrase used to sum it up.\n...everyone I met seemed to have done a lot more walking!  After a bit more walking, and a few more breaks for water, snacks and resting my feet, I was already a bit behind schedule for my plan to have lunch in the village of Drymen.\nI also was starting to think that my snacks, including a Belgian bun and an apple that I had picked up during my train journey, were getting a bit heavy. When I found I could fill my water bottle at the outdoor tap of a cafe just before Drymen (there are in fact many such opportunities to pick up extra water along the way), I decided to skip the half mile or so diversion into the village itself and instead crack on.\n Conic Hill rises above the surrounding fields.\n  It wasn\u0026rsquo;t long before I was starting to see a more dramatic Scottish landscape emerge in the distance, and then there was Conic Hill (361 m), the first proper climb of the WHW.\nIt was a slightly warm trek up to the top and I had a few breaks, worrying that my legs hadn\u0026rsquo;t experienced anything like this in Hertfordshire, but before too long I had a feeling of deja vu (having previously climbed the hill with Clare starting from Balmaha) as I reached the \u0026lsquo;summit\u0026rsquo; for that spectacular view along the islands in the middle of Loch Lomond.\nThis time there weren\u0026rsquo;t any highland cows to surprise the unwary, but the path was under repair, making the descent towards a Balmaha a bit tricky in places.\n A view like that from the top of Conic Hill is worth a second visit.\n  I was slightly concerned about where I\u0026rsquo;d get food as I exited the forest into the village at Balmaha. On our previous trip, The Oak Tree pub there had been pretty busy. As it turned out I needn\u0026rsquo;t have worried as there was lots of space, perhaps because it was a warm evening and there was plenty of daylight, making it nice to be outside. Or perhaps because it didn\u0026rsquo;t have the Euros on and Scotland were playing.\nI felt I\u0026rsquo;d burnt a few calories, so went for a two-course option of soup followed by haggis. I was also already glad that I\u0026rsquo;d brought my flip flops and could take my boots off for a bit.\nBy this time in the evening, it looked like the campsite at Cashel would be a good bet for the overnight stop. Between courses, I decided I\u0026rsquo;d better call them to double check they had space. [Generally I found all the campsites had space at short notice given I only had a \u0026lsquo;backpacker tent\u0026rsquo; (in fact not even really a tent in my case).]\n[I tried] not to eat my haggis course like I was taking part in a speed-eating competition...  They did indeed have space, but also ideally wanted to close check in at ~8 pm or maybe slightly later. I realised to cover the 3 miles or so in time, I\u0026rsquo;d better get going!\nAfter trying not to eat my haggis course like I was taking part in a speed-eating competition, I set off, mindful of the fact I could be keeping people waiting. Fortunately, this part of the route along Loch Lomond is a pleasant and easy track, and I was able to get a bit of a move on with the finish for the day in mind.\nI was giving a bit less regard to my potentially delicate legs now that I felt that being able to stop and have a shower might depend on my rate of progress, even finding it was ok to jog some of the slight downhills.\nI arrived at ~8:30 pm, just in time to find the campsite staff packing up the shop for the day and ready to check me in.\n The sunset at Cashel.\n  That evening was my first brush with the midges – although a slight breeze seemed to be keeping them somewhat away, I did realise that assembling my bivvy bag under some trees by the stream that runs through the site wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best choice of location. I didn\u0026rsquo;t see anyone else wearing a midge net though, and thought it might be uncool to be the first to break mine out!\nThere was then just enough time left to wander to the beach at the loch edge and enjoy the sunset before turning in.\nCashel to nr Doune Byre (day 2)  Today\u0026rsquo;s distance: 18.4 miles/29.6 km Elevation gain: 457 m Time walking: 7 h 16 min Distance to date: 41.9 miles/67.4 km  After a shower at the campsite, and a minor detour to see the (Belted) Galloway cows in a nearby field, I set off in the mist following the trail along the eastern side of Loch Lomond.\n Mist wasn\u0026rsquo;t unbeautiful!\n  Because my trip to the cows had meant I\u0026rsquo;d left Cashel a little later than I planned to, at ~9:30 am, I only got a few kilometres before deciding to stop for lunch (bean chilli) at the Clansman Bar of the Rowardennan Hotel (which started serving food at 12 pm).\nWhile I waited, I was able to do a little charging of my phone batteries and looking at the route ahead.\nBoth my guidebook and accounts from others who had done the walk before mentioned that this next section of the way was one of the toughest, but somehow that hadn\u0026rsquo;t really sunk in.\nHaving walked some of the more southerly part of the Loch Lomond shoreline the previous day and looking at the apparently flat profile of the route, I was thinking \u0026lsquo;how bad can it be?\u0026rsquo; and considering whether I needed to book in for the camping at Beinglas or even whether I might get further than that.\nOn this section of the route, there is also a choice to take the \u0026lsquo;high route\u0026rsquo; or the \u0026lsquo;low route\u0026rsquo;, with the path apparently splitting just after the Ptarmigan Lodge and converging again shortly after the bothy at Rowchowish.\nI was becoming a connoisseur of steps  I decided to take the low route (which is reputedly harder but more scenic), but actually don\u0026rsquo;t recall seeing the high route diverge. According to the guidebook, it might be that only the low route is signposted.\nAs I headed towards Inversnaid, I started to see why this part of the WHW has its reputation.\nI can recall that day as having an awful lot of steps as the path wound up and down the tree-covered hillside above the loch. In fact, I felt I was becoming a connoisseur of steps.\nThere were steps of the kind formed by wooden planks across the path (and places where these had eroded leaving the planks as kind of extra obstacles on the slope) and steps formed from the rock itself. Some of the rocky steps were more or less a regular height, but others were much bigger, and there were also places where they seemed more of an erratic natural configuration of stones rather than steps as such.\n Time for a break in the bothy.\n  I didn\u0026rsquo;t see Rob Roy\u0026rsquo;s cave (which being marked on the map, I had assumed was some kind of unmissable tourist attraction, but in hindsight is quite a bit less obvious).\nI also nearly missed the Rowchoish Bothy, only glancing to the side and noticing its roof (it\u0026rsquo;s a little way from the path) after almost passing it.\nI took the chance to take a look inside and, finding it deserted, stayed for a short rest and also felt I had to take the opportunity for a bit of whistle practice (The Bothy Band are an influential group in Irish traditional music).\nBack on my way, along the path that continued to wind up and down the hillside, I arrived at Inversnaid, known for its waterfall, at ~4 pm. I was seeing that I might be quite late to reach the campsite and tried to call it, only to find I had no signal.\nAfter a little rest, and deciding against the detour for the best view of the waterfall, I filled up my water bottle (the hotel there also had an outside tap for the purpose) and carried on.\n The lower waterfall at Inversnaid.\n  The path didn\u0026rsquo;t get any easier, and in places the uneven rocks now had a steep drop on the left down to the loch.\nI felt I had to take care not to overbalance (I was glad of the walking poles now) and wasn\u0026rsquo;t making quick progress. On the other hand, there were beautiful views over the loch, and the woods themselves continued to be spectacular in places. (This area is a temperate rainforest).\nAs mid-evening approached, I was wondering if I could find anywhere to wild camp for the night. However, the path itself was quite narrow, and the prospect of sheltering under one of the large boulders to its side was a bit creepy, even if it would be unlikely to move (I\u0026rsquo;m sure Rob Roy would have been fine with it).\nAfter a while further, I finally started to see parts of the shore that had narrow shingle beaches rather than a steep drop to the water and, in one or two places, people were setting up camp. I decided that it might be for the best to do the same, rather than pressing on further along the path on tired legs.\nThe only question was exactly where.\nI was seeing a series of apparently suitable spots, but I also didn\u0026rsquo;t want to fall too far behind where I had hoped to get to (and was still some way short of the Glen Falloch no-camping zone at the north end of the loch).\nI noticed not one, but many piles of mysterious droppings by the water's edge  I found one promising spot, a slightly wider beach where the path dropped down almost to the shore, and started to settle down, laying out my mat and having some water and a break, and I decided to take a look around before pitching camp.\nThat was when I noticed not one, but many piles of mysterious droppings by the water\u0026rsquo;s edge. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what had left them but from the size was guessing small deer or maybe giant rats.\nWhatever it was I was doubtful about being disturbed by it in the night.\nI decided to move on.\nBefore long, I arrived at another wide beach where a stream met the loch and which had a picturesque marshy area dotted with irises behind.\nExploring round that beach, I found areas where the remains of campfires suggested people had stayed before and, following the shore round, I found a flat grassy area with a romantic view over the loch. I set up camp, before eating my dinner of cold soaked noodles and oat bars.\n Sleeping with a view of \u0026lsquo;Island I Vow\u0026rsquo;.\n  As I took off my boots to enter the bivvy bag, I noticed that the sole of one of them didn\u0026rsquo;t feel as attached to the main structure as I had hoped.\nI\u0026rsquo;d had some issues with this after my practice walks back home, but it seemed that my effort to reattach it with glue hadn\u0026rsquo;t been the glorious success I\u0026rsquo;d assumed.\nI decided that I\u0026rsquo;d worry about that in the morning\u0026hellip;\nDoune Byre to Bridge of Orchy (day 3)  Today\u0026rsquo;s distance: 22.9 miles/36.9 km Elevation gain: 726 m Time walking: 8 h 43 min Distance to date: 64.8 miles/104.3 km  Despite a bit of noise from the road on far side of the loch, and rain that started during the night I slept pretty well.\nBy the time I was woken by my alarm at 7 am, I was ready for an early start to try to make up some time. Although the rain had slowed a bit, I still felt the need to contort myself into my waterproofs before I left the bivvy bag (which was just about possible). I also made an optimistic attempt to reattach the rubber sole of my boot, which I found was flapping loose at the heel, with some duct tape.\nI packed up my bivvy bag, noting that it was now quite a bit damper and heavier, and got on my way towards Inverarnan (which I\u0026rsquo;d hoped to reach the previous day). My camping spot was actually more or less the point that marked the end of the tough section of trail that I\u0026rsquo;d faced the day before and only about a kilometre from the bothy at Doune Byre.\nI found my way blocked by a menacing horned creature with black fur  By the time I\u0026rsquo;d reached the bothy, my handiwork with the duct tape was already coming unstuck and I decided I should use the shelter to see if I could make a better repair with the remainder of the tape.\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if there would be anyone in the bothy (apparently it has room for around ten people), so I called out a cheery \u0026ldquo;Hello!\u0026rdquo; and opened the door. In the grey morning light, I could now see that there was a small tent pitched inside. I never saw the occupants, but I did hear what sounded like French voices and a lot of giggling. I was a bit concerned that the sound of my perfectly normal hiking activity of taping my boots back together might cause alarm, but also didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that whatever I might say would necessarily reassure. I made my repairs as quickly as I could and then was back on my way.\n Finally, they moved off the path.\n  Shortly after leaving the bothy, the path drops back down towards the loch side and there I found my way blocked by a menacing horned creature with black fur.\nThe lyrics to Black Sabbath \u0026ldquo;What is this that stands before me? Figure in black which points at me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; sprang to mind – what the heck was this apparition seen through the morning rain? After convincing myself that it was some kind of sheep or goat, rather than actually Satan (I have since learnt how this area is actually known for having feral goats!!), I walked forwards.\nThe creature and the small herd I then saw behind it reluctantly ceded the path. As they moved away I also discovered what had certainly been responsible for the droppings I had seen the evening before.\nI was soon at the Beinglas campsite, where I was able to pick up breakfast from the bar (a morning roll with bacon and potato scone) and resupply with water and flapjack.\nIn the camp shop, I bought more duct tape and some string to try to hold my boots together for a bit longer (the tape I\u0026rsquo;d applied in the bothy hadn\u0026rsquo;t stayed in place, but a spare shoelace I\u0026rsquo;d used to tie the sole up was at least seeming more promising). While sipping a lemonade and waiting for my phone to charge, I set about making a temporary repair as best I could before heading back to the trail.\n Repair attempt number 3.\n  The path follows the picturesque river Falloch for some way past various pools and rapids as well as the \u0026lsquo;Falls of Falloch\u0026rsquo; (probably best viewed from the other side of the river).\nAround this section there were also various footbridges over streams/gullies joining the river. For reasons that are still not clear to me, some of these bridges were preceded by large warning triangle signs marked \u0026lsquo;Caution!\u0026rsquo;. I feel they could have been more specific, but whatever the hazard, I made it past without incident.\nAfter a few kilometres (and crossing the river by bridge at one point), the path turns towards the hills and passes under the railway line.\nOn the map, this underpass is labelled as a \u0026lsquo;sheep creep\u0026rsquo; and it was indeed quite low for the two-legged traveller, particularly with a backpack. As I progressed through it towards the light at the far end, the ceiling got lower and lower. I just managed to squat my way through without having to put my hands and knees in the muddy puddles on the floor (or drag my rucksack through the muck).\n Glen Falloch waterfalls\n  Apart from this incident, and one or two short climbs, the path was fairly easy going, and I was making good progress through scenery that was now more hills and mountains and less rivers and woods.\nI decided to skip the detour to Crianlarich and push on towards Tyndrum, where I knew there were restaurants and the Green Welly Stop (once described as somewhere you can buy anything you might have forgotten for a trip to Scotland, and \u0026lsquo;anything\u0026rsquo; was looking like walking boots).\n View looking south at Crainlarich. The mountain on the far left is possibly Cruach Ardrain.\n  It might have been my legs as the day went on, but the stretch from Crianlarich to Tyndrum felt a lot longer than that from Inveranan to Crianlarich (despite actually being less distance). On the sections through the forest (just after the exit to Crianlarich), there were some steep climbs.\nBecause I was reapplying the string round my boots as it wore through and the sole recommenced flapping every few kilometres, I was also playing leapfrog with other walkers.\nThe last few miles to Tyndrum were flatter and generally easier underfoot, as you made your way through farmland and past the remains of St Fillan’s Priory.\nFinally I saw the outskirts of Tyndrum coming into view and made my way towards the shop; realising I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had much to eat since breakfast and it was now early evening, I had pizza before heading over to see what could be done for my boots.\nWell, of course, the answer was that not too much could be done for them and I needed a new pair.\n...at least one friend had suggested that I should have been buying new boots the weekend before I left  Despite some angst about discarding the boots that had got me so far without blisters, I could also see that if the soles completely detached in the wilder section of the walk to come it would be extremely embarrassing to explain why I needed help.\nBefore I\u0026rsquo;d left home, at least one friend had suggested that I should have been buying new boots the weekend before I left. And people replying to my posts on the fediverse concurred!\n Old boots. New boots.\n  After a lot of trying on and walking around in different sizes and styles of boots (and emptying the damp contents of my rucksack on the floor in order to find any remaining pair of clean socks), I settled on a pair, made the purchase and consigned the old pair to the bin.\nAs this process had resulted in a good long break, although it was now into evening, I was feeling rested, so I decided to carry on towards Bridge of Orchy (which is ~6.5 miles along the \u0026lsquo;old military road\u0026rsquo; from Tyndrum). The trail was very quiet at this time of day, and I had some spectacular views to myself as well the sight of a pair of deer.\nAt one point, I saw the train heading towards Fort William, and as I reached Bridge of Orchy, I saw the sleeper train pulling away towards Glasgow.\n A final push to the campsite. Beinn Dorain rises impressively (right).\n  However, I was heading to something less luxurious than a train. After crossing the titular bridge, a hiker pointed me to the suggested wild camping area.\nThere were already 10–12 tents in the small field nearest the hotel, but I found that there were some more nice spots to pitch ~100 m further along the river so set up there for the night.\nWith another day down, I set up for a quiet night\u0026rsquo;s sleep in the lee of the mountains, ready for the wildest sections of the walk that would await me the next day (and which await the next post).\nImage gallery                                      Extra shots Some more personal blogs of people walking the WHW giving experiences/time-frames that differ to mine.\n A long-standing blog with a lot of Scottish walks\nhttps://airdrierambler.wordpress.com/?s=West+highland+way Another long-standing blog, with an account of a 2024 4-day trip along the WHW\nhttps://www.alananna.co.uk/blog/tag/west-highland-way/ A LeJogger\u0026rsquo;s (someone doing the Land\u0026rsquo;s End to John o\u0026rsquo;Groats hike) posts on the 7-day section of the WHW (note the links take a while to load after clicking)\nhttps://www.uklongdistancefootpaths.com/west-highland-way Newsletter following the adventures of Eve and her father (who describe themselves as autistic) on their 14 days along the WHW\nhttps://www.ourspectrumadventures.com/tag/west-highland-way/   Credits The map is sourced from OpenStreetMaps, licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF).\nMap traces were plotted using GPX studio (MIT license).\n","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2024/07/west-highland-way-ii/","summary":"The West Highland Way is the UK’s most popular long-distance path.

I hence found myself trying to figure out what I\u0026rsquo;d need to do to walk a long-distance path at relatively short notice.\nWhy did I choose this challenge?\nPartly, of course, because of the beautiful scenery I\u0026rsquo;d seen when I\u0026rsquo;d previously visited the area for my wedding (and actually walked a bit on the WHW near Loch Lomond and Conic Hill) and also because I\u0026rsquo;d been wondering whether wild camping (allowed generally in Scotland, and on all of the WHW apart from a couple of areas around Loch Lomond) would be a fun experience, probably encouraged by the tales of bike-packing that I\u0026rsquo;d read in Cycling UK\u0026rsquo;s magazine.\n A view of the WHW path near Kinlochleven on the way to Fort William\n  I also liked the idea of a lower impact holiday that was accessible via train and did not need a lot of elaborate equipment, as well as something that would take you completely away from a computer.\nFinally, I also had a \u0026lsquo;curiosity\u0026rsquo; about how bad the notorious Scottish midges could possibly be, particularly as the threat of these wee beasties has been denying us holidays in Scotland (apart from the special exception we made for the wedding)!\nI somehow felt a bit less enthused about the idea of walking for 96 miles, but once suggested, kept thinking it would be a shame not to at least try.\nThe \u0026lsquo;no plan\u0026rsquo; plan Since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how long the trek would take me, and knew I was wanting to do at least some wild camping, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to book accommodation in advance so that I did not need to meet a rigid schedule.\nHowever, not being an experienced hiker, I was also wanting to keep the weight of my backpack down, so made an early decision not to carry a lot of food, but more rely on shops and restaurants along the way.\nWhile investigating the various items and equipment I might want to take with me, I found it tricky to envisage what I might really need or not need.\nSome of this was down to not having done any actual multi-day hiking/camping before, but also many of the internet\u0026rsquo;s prominent blogs/review stories of the WHW were quite heavy on affiliate links or otherwise promoting particular items, so it was difficult to judge their independence.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve made this post to capture some of my thoughts on how I decided what to take (highlighted in bold in the next section) and whether there were things I\u0026rsquo;d do differently in hindsight.\nThings I took with me The first couple of items I bought were things that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have at all and would definitely need if I was going to camp the WHW – a rucksack and some kind of shelter.\nI was reluctant to buy a brand new rucksack as I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how much I would use it or even if I\u0026rsquo;d find that actually walking with all my kit wasn\u0026rsquo;t for me without more training.\nBy contrast, I wanted to get something pretty quickly, so that I could get started with some walks and get a feel for what lay before me.\n The final rucksack. In order to make it have a little less of a military vibe, I sewed some fun patches on!\n  I did little bit of searching for secondhand backpacks before thinking maybe I could get an army surplus rucksack (2.94 kg, without the detachable side pouches). At least this was easy to find (there seem to be quite a number of shops with stock of such things) and how bad could it be if it had been standard issue for the army only a few years ago?\nI reasoned it at least should be heavy duty!\nWhile perusing the bewildering array of surplus equipment, I also noticed that among the bivvy bags and tents in tasteful shades of green camo, there was the so-called \u0026lsquo;Dutch army bivvy bag\u0026rsquo; (1.55 kg), which is a hooped bivvy bag that is somewhat tent like (it has one hoop and an insect net so your face isn\u0026rsquo;t open to the elements/midges) but is still quite minimalist.\nOn a slight impulse, I decided to buy that as well. This requires some tent pegs (120 g).\nBy the time my new items had arrived a few days later, I was already questioning my choices.\nThe rucksack has mixed reviews on the internet and it seemed questionable whether I had the right size (there are long-back and short-back versions and I had the short back) or in fact whether the short back was suitable for anyone that wasn\u0026rsquo;t also wearing the mysterious \u0026lsquo;webbing belt\u0026rsquo;. But I ploughed on with them\u0026hellip; and will say neither purchase felt like a mistake in the end, although both could be characterized as robust rather than ultralight.\nSleeping bag (1.05 kg). I\u0026rsquo;d originally thought to take an old sleeping bag that I had (I think it must be 30 years old), but after some practice walks, which brought the weight of my equipment into focus, I changed my mind.\nIt seems that sleeping bags have progressed over the years, and I was able to replace it with a relatively cheap modern one that was about half the weight (saving over a kg) and about half the volume, yet apparently was at least as warm.\nSleeping mat (300 g). Here, I just stuck with the cheap foam mat I had, which is quite light and robust, although there are hiking-suitable air-bed options these days.\n Setting up the bivvy bag for a test.\n  Trekking poles (0.5 kg). I\u0026rsquo;d never walked with poles before and was a bit unsure whether they would be worth having or an extra thing to worry about. I now think they\u0026rsquo;re great and are very helpful for assisting your legs uphill, keeping your balance downhill and getting down big steps.\nI went for cheap ones that have the spring/pin mechanism to adjust. As per the warning in their instructions (!), the adjustment holes do whistle in any wind. I was sort of fine with that though, being accustomed to whistling noises.\nWalking boots. I didn\u0026rsquo;t buy new ones, which we\u0026rsquo;ll come back to in a future post!\nFlip-flops (232 g). I was really unsure whether these would be worth the weight/space, but am glad I took them. It was really good to be able to take off my boots without having bare feet. Also I discovered that I could wear socks with them (just sort of push the sock between your big toes where the toe-post goes), so it was the right decision to not buy new sandal-style flip-flops.\nFor clothing, I chose two longsleeve base layers (175 g each), two fleeces (one slightly warmer/heavier than the other; 450 g and 267 g), a pair of lightweight hiking trousers (320 g), some thermal running leggings (264 g), three pairs of quick drying pants (100 g), four pairs of walking socks (150 g), a synthetic t-shirt (140 g), a bobble hat (92 g), a \u0026lsquo;Buff-style\u0026rsquo; head garment and a sunhat (100 g). [The socks were new, because you don\u0026rsquo;t skimp on socks on a hike.]\nAlso, because it\u0026rsquo;s Scotland, a waterproof jacket (1.02 kg) and waterproof trousers (387 g).\nOf these, the only item I didn\u0026rsquo;t use at all was the running leggings. The head garment was helpful to keep the light out of my eyes when sleeping. The bobble hat was only really nice to have at the top of hills (particularly the top of Ben Nevis), which were still chilly.\nMaps and guidebook (460 g). The guidebook had excerpts from OS maps covering the WHW route, but I also took the two Landranger (1:50,000) maps covering the second half of the route. I never used the OS maps, and think unless you plan to deliberately depart from the route, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be necessary.\nCompass (38 g). On one or two occasions, I found the compass useful to check that I was going more-or-less where I expected. I suppose I could have used my phone (compass or just GPS), but to feel like a proper hiker you need one, and it\u0026rsquo;s not heavy!\n Best take that compass and some off-grid essentials.\n  Battery packs and cables (432 g). I took two device-charging power banks (Clare had originally bought these to keep her phone topped up during a virtual marathon). They weigh ~200 g each, and having both was overkill in the end, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure where I\u0026rsquo;d be able to charge on the route.\nThese did prove handy to top up my GPS watch (which didn\u0026rsquo;t noticeably deplete the battery pack, but did need a charge once per day of hiking).\nA head torch (81 g) and spare batteries (34 g). A head torch with a low-power red light option was very useful for seeing in the bivvy bag. I did the walk at the summer solstice, so there was a lot of daylight and I never needed it apart from that.\nGuessing it might not get used frequently, I went for a torch that took AAA batteries rather than one containing a re-chargeable battery. I took some spare batteries, but don\u0026rsquo;t think you would ever need these for the WHW unless you decided to walk in the dark.\nMidge repellents (100 g), headnet and lightweight gloves (84 g). To fend off the midges.\nSuncream (100 g).\nA location beacon (133 g). I happened to have a personal location beacon (i.e. a device that can send an emergency signal via satellite).\nI was in two minds whether to take it as, on the one hand, it really should be completely unnecessary for the WHW, being a very heavily frequented route, but on the other hand there are always \u0026lsquo;what ifs\u0026rsquo; about any kind of medical emergency that might happen with no phone signal and no-one else around.\nI do now feel that the only points where you might be more than a few minutes from someone else are when you are wild camping and generally (but not always) the mobile signal was pretty good anyway.\nThere might be a place for it if you felt you were departing more from the track, but I certainly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have bought one of these specially for walking the WHW. However, I did have a bracelet with an ICE number on, which is always a good idea.\n Night in the garden\u0026hellip;\n  Toiletries (400 g) and first-aid kit (200 g). As well as my glasses, contact lens, hand gel, toothpaste (decanted into a small container) and a toothbrush, I took various first-aid items, such as plasters, micropore tape, antiseptic cream, various blister plasters and moleskin, and anti-chafing gel. I eventually managed to find and include the pair of tick tweezers we had bought before our previous trip to Scotland. For soap, I took some pieces of a bar of soap rather than the expensive liquid \u0026lsquo;hiking\u0026rsquo; soaps in tiny bottles (this seemed to work well). I also had a small hiking towel (189 g).\nFor water, I took three plastic water bottles (146 g) from 750 ml to 1.0 l. In general, plastic bottles were fine for this trip; although they are less durable than metal bottles, they are quite a lot lighter and I already had some that I could reuse. Taking several smaller bottles reduced the worry on if I managed to damage one.\nThere are a few options for making water found on route from streams etc. safe to drink. The best method for this is boiling, but there are also filters and tablets that can be used, so once I\u0026rsquo;d decided not to take a stove, I decided on taking water purification tablets with me (some that at least claim to kill viruses, bacteria and parasites, such as Cryptosporidium), as these were smaller, cheaper and lighter weight than a filter.\nI was expecting that I might not need to use these (given the many stopping points on the WHW) but felt I should have some just in case I somehow ran short of water. I never actually used them (and never needed to fill up with more than ~1.5 l of water at any point).\nFor food, I carried a plastic fork and spoon (15 g) and a plastic tub (172 g) that I could use as a bowl.\nDog waste bags (10 g). (Another ICE carry).\nRubbish bags (50 g) for keeping kit dry.\nA tin whistle, to keep up my hobby; I took my plastic one – only 45 g including the case – I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if a lighter instrument exists!\nAnd finally, money/cards, phone (200 g), ear plugs (2 g), synthetic fabric bags (65 g; for rucksack organisation), and some string (15 g) and duct tape (20 g). (Yes, I used the string and duct tape, which we\u0026rsquo;ll again come back to in a future post!).\nThings I didn\u0026rsquo;t take with me I thought long and hard about whether I needed to take a stove.\nIn the end [but not until after I\u0026rsquo;d experimented with a DIY meths burner based on a fizzy drink can (eventually boiled some water, but didn\u0026rsquo;t work as well as I hoped so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really recommend it!)], I decided the downsides (it\u0026rsquo;s more weight to carry, you might set things on fire, it\u0026rsquo;s something you might not use much in future) outweighed the upsides (warm food and the possibility to boil water), for this trip at least.\nNot taking a stove meant that I also didn\u0026rsquo;t need any new metal cooking utensils.\nAnother item of camping equipment I decided against was a tarp.\nAlthough it would have been nice to have, I didn\u0026rsquo;t take a camera other than my phone (my alternative was a bridge camera that weighs ~0.75 kg). I think this was the right approach, as apart from the weight, it would be a pain to keep dry and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a good solution to comfortably carry it where I could easily reach it for taking pictures.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t take a trowel (necessary to bury poo when wild camping):\n I wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy that the WHW was sufficiently enough of a wilderness that it would be OK to bury any waste away from water sources and where no-one would stumble upon it. Even overpriced hiking trowels (with special compartments for toilet paper 😀) are heavy and bulky.  Instead I opted for taking a number of dog waste bags – I don\u0026rsquo;t own a dog, but have walked them before, so was confident that if the worst came to the worst I could deal with any eventuality.\nI also didn\u0026rsquo;t take a rucksack cover. The rucksack itself is somewhat water resistant, and I was doubtful that any cover would attach well or fully stop water entering anyway.\nI used rubbish bags to keep items inside the rucksack dry, and also a large plastic bag to put the rucksack in to keep off heavy rain when not wearing it.\nLast-minute preparation To convince myself that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a crazy plan to buy the train ticket to Glasgow, I did a little last-minute preparation – namely, finding some time for a few long walks with my rucksack.\nOver one weekend I managed 2 days in a row where I walked 20 miles per day. However, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t as confidence inspiring as it first sounds as my calves did not feel ready to continue afterwards and took a few days to recover from their soreness!\n On \u0026lsquo;hills\u0026rsquo; the of Hertsfordshire\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m behind the camera with the rucksack on.\n  The rucksack itself wasn\u0026rsquo;t as uncomfortable as I\u0026rsquo;d been fearing from some reviews. It had just enough adjustment for me to feel I was able to distribute the load between shoulders and hips (I had to fully tighten the buckles on the \u0026lsquo;load lifter\u0026rsquo; shoulder straps to effectively lengthen the rucksack, and do up the hip belt a bit tighter than I might have thought). I never had any problems with it chafing even when only wearing it over a slightly damp base layer a lot of the time.\nI did feel the need to improvise a chest strap to keep the shoulder straps together though. After a practice hike of a few hours without one, my shoulders were starting to feel it even without trekking poles.\nI also tested the bivvy bag and sleeping bag combination in our garden, although didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to try them in any actual rain.\nThe weigh-in A final weigh-in of everything came to a total of ~12.5 kg (not including any food, water, hiking poles or the clothes I was wearing as I left home).\nThis certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t feel light but also seemed not to be crazy heavy compared to what I\u0026rsquo;d seen mentioned in my guidebook and on the internet.\n Off I go.\n  We\u0026rsquo;ll pick up where the adventure starts with my train journey from Letchworth in another post soon\u0026hellip;\n Extra shots  Guidebooks on the WHW\nhttps://www.westhighlandwayshop.org/collections/guides The complete set of 1:25,000 OS maps you\u0026rsquo;d need for the WHW\nhttps://shop.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/os-explorer-west-highland-way-map-set/ Another WHW overview website run by a baggage transfer company (lots of pictures)\nhttps://westhighlandway.com/ Detailed info on various alcohol (and other) stoves\nhttps://zenstoves.net/Stoves.htm  ","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2024/06/west-highland-way-prep/","summary":"I decided to walk the West Highland Way (running some 96 miles, or 154 km, from Milngavie, just north of Glasgow, to Fort William) after some original solo holiday plans fell through with a couple of months to go.

That is, I finally completed the London marathon 21st April 2024, with a time of 6:33:02. Oh my gosh, has this ever been a lot of hard work – I’ve effectively trained for it three times after first the delays of the pandemic pushed it into 2023, then injury meaning I had to defer to 2024. So my initial reaction to crossing the line was really just one of relief.\n ©Spotograf. A few metres to go.\n  But, starting at the end, first some thank yous.\nThank you to the coaches, committee, purple (slow) group and so many others from North Herts Road Runners (NHRR); it’s all your fault this happened in the first place (i.e. I only applied for the ballot because I saw members crossing the line looking happy!), and the dedication from the coaches and positivity to someone who’s not really standard marathon material has been amazing.\nThank you to those at my work and my family who’ve had to put up with me biffing on about training for so long and who have done so gracefully.\nThank you to the volunteers at London marathon itself who do so much work to make sure everything goes smoothly, as well as the professionals who do the set up and work to keep us safe (not forgetting the working dogs).\nThank you to Gade Valley Harriers for organising their marathon training runs with no time limits.\nThank you to everyone who sponsored me for the donations to Garden House Hospice; we raised a total of over £600.\nhttps://www.justgiving.com/page/clare-hooley-london2024\n And finally thank you to James, who’s been with me every step of the way, both metaphorically and more literally (carrying all my water on the long training runs).\nWith that said, let’s pick up the story from where we left off in the rest of the blog posts on my marathon journey at 1 week to race day.\nPreparation week By this time, tapering meant the last of the weekend long runs was down to a more manageable 10 km [my longest training run (well run–walk that was mostly walk) was of 20 miles back on Easter Sunday on the flattest easiest route I could possibly think of – along the Cambridge guided busway towards Longstanton; I lost all ability to run at ~17 miles, and it took 5 hours], so I suddenly did find myself with a little free time on my hands.\n Must pay attention, I have been warned ‘If the plastic carrier is melting your temperature is far too high’.\n  The first mission – a t-shirt name. To be honest, I wasn’t totally sure about drawing attention from the crowds but ‘everyone’ says it helps and it was kinda nice at the Cambridge half, where your name was on your race bib, so you didn’t have any extra palaver.\nSecond, I needed batches of my promised marathon cookies (see the previous post for the cookie recipe) to take to work.\nThird, I really needed to try and overcome my maranoia. I wasn’t totally niggle free, so it was perhaps justified being worried about it hurting or getting injured, but thoughts like ‘couldn’t do the marathon because my shoelace came undone and I fell over in Morrisons’, ‘couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the marathon because I got hit by a speeding mobility scooter’ are totally normal right? I even got an anxiety dream where I refreshed the Met Office’s weather for Greenwich and it came up as 40°C. However much you know you’re being a bit silly about it all, it just kept coming.\nThen it was time to go into London to collect my race bib and t-shirt (I have no problem with collecting the t-shirt in advance rather than on the finish line, but running t-shirts being notoriously small anyway, it’s more of a problem that even the official size of the ladies t-shirts on the label turned out to be a size smaller than we signed up for, so although I can get in it, I can’t actually wear it for running 😣).\n By this point, my maranoia had focussed on not making the time limit for the official finish on The Mall. I’d made a honest best guess for my predicted time in a best-possible scenario of 6:45, which meant I’d been put in blue wave 18 (that’s the last one, crossing the line some 1:20 after the elite men’s start), but the event guide had made clear that anyone expecting over 7 hours should ask to start from the green waves, which gives you more time to finish as you cross the start line quite a bit ahead of someone in the last red or blue start waves.\n Over a marathon at my pace, 15 mins really isn’t that much, so I was fretting on if I’d done the right thing. But pulling myself together, I told myself really, I expected 6:45 not 7 hours, and if something went wrong, you do actually have 8 hours to do it in. Then I was just more oh my gosh, that countdown clock over the expo entrance really really isn’t long. (And ‘couldn’t do the marathon because I tripped over a stand edge at the expo’).\nOne day to go, and my sister and her husband arrived as part of my personal cheering squad. I’m not sure I was the best host, but I made sure I showed off breakfast in Letchworth’s best cafe and pasta at the Italian restaurant (I had practiced my menu choices prior to the Cambridge half to make sure it was race suitable).\nI did the obligatory ‘flat me’ for social media (it doesn’t show the little squirrel earrings I also wore in honour of our NHRR’s black squirrel logo, the real thing of which typically weren’t in evidence on our visit to Norton Common).\n By this time, we knew the weather was looking very very good (if anything a bit cold for those doing a substantial amount of walking), so I chose a pair of cow leggings (I\u0026rsquo;d had lots of positive comments at the Cambridge half with a similar set), t-shirt and club vest.\n  Then it just remained to try and sleep. I can’t say I was totally successful, but it could have been a lot worse, and it’s not like I had to contend with a hotel.\nRace day Alarm at 5:45am. Wasn’t asleep anyway. Anti-chaffing gel (a necessary game changer for me) and clothes on. Bag with food and pre-race drinks packed; very silly book to try and distract me from myself bought.\nAnd off to Stevenage to catch the coach organised by Fairlands Valley Spartans (thank you to them for doing that, as it cuts out another stress not having to negotiate cross-London public transport).\nIt wasn’t a long journey, although long enough to start really feeling nerves; I don’t know London, but even to me it was obvious when we were going past the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, then under the Thames, then you pass under a bridge with an advertising hoarding saying ‘good luck runners’ and…. eeek. We were at Blackheath.\n The route for the different colour starts.\n  I could really have done with them not playing Chariots of Fire on the speakers just at the moment I was headed to the blue runners’ assembly area, as it just emphasised the occasion. Thankfully, within the area itself, it wasn’t music, more information and interviews. Of course, what was now apparent is yes, it was ridiculously cold with quite a breeze heading over the field and I still had 3 hours before I’d get to go into the start pen.\nHowever, (after going to the loo of course, no queue at that time) I found myself a space in the lee of the barrier around the recycling bins (this was also conveniently near my baggage lorry and facing away from the main area where runners would actually congregate while going into the start pens). Time to make use of that silly book, and have another snack.\n...the screens proclaimed how ‘blue is your best colour’  I was soon joined by a few more people who’d taken the opportunity for some huddling out the wind, including two lovely ladies who were also wave 18, and hence were also in for a wait. By then, the arena was filling up, and you started to spot people getting into their fancy dresses. The speakers cut to describing the women’s elite start, and soon enough after that the first waves were being sent to their pens (still 1:30 to go for me) and there was the applause in respect for Kelvin Kiptum before the elite men’s and mass start.\nIf you turned in the correct direction, then the scale of just how big London is became clear, and this was only from the blue area (the screens proclaimed how ‘blue is your best colour’). And of course, it was apparent in the queue for the loos.\nFinally, 11:20 (a little late) and there was the call for blue wave 18 to go the start pen. My new friends and I wished each other good luck, reluctantly put our hoodies into the charity collection bins (it was still very cold), and tried to remember to breath. A short walk round the corner, and there it was… the start gantry…\nOn the course Thankfully, as hoped, once I was actually running, the nerves vanished. It really is just one foot in front of the other, just as in any training run. Except with more runners, and far more spectators, around you.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s certainly not every run that you go past a purple dinosaur while it exclaims \u0026ldquo;Help, I\u0026rsquo;m deflating\u0026rdquo; to a friend.\nAt my pace, most of us were following some sort of run–walk plan, but as we all had very different intervals for that, you needed to weave carefully around people for the stops and starts. It is also important to not let the adrenaline get to you and set off too fast, but it’s not so much a problem for me as you can’t get too carried away in a 2-min interval.\nIt's certainly not every run that you go past a purple dinosaur...  The first section is actually quite residential, but a fair few marshalls were needed to take us safely over the 11 speed bumps; I do wonder if they were replaced in shifts or had been shouting warnings for 2 hours by the time I reached them (plus carrying signs on long poles visible above our heads).\nAt 2.75 miles, the blue route joined up with those on the red start; this made the race the busiest I had all day and was a bit awe inspiring. Mile 3 takes you downhill, and, as expected, this was the fastest I went! There was someone with a sign ‘all downhill from here’ (in reality it’s just flat after this).\nOnwards towards our first official London landmark, the Cutty Sark.\nSpectator team report – James  Although I have also run the London marathon back in 2014, I\u0026rsquo;ve never spectated it in person, so with Clare safely on the coach to the start, I was quite excited to be meeting up with the other members of our small cheering team to head into the big smoke hoping to catch a glimpse of her race.\nWe figured that, despite the crowds, it should be possible to see Clare at a few points on the route.\nAfter heading in on the train, we decided to make for the Cutty Sark. Not only is this a well-known landmark relatively early in the route, Neil (Clare\u0026rsquo;s brother in law) has a interest in nautical history, so it also seemed to be appropriate from that point of view.\nIt appeared that we had plenty of time, and, as we expected the tube would be crowded, we made the questionable impulse decision to take the River Bus for a more scenic journey. All went smoothly getting the tube to Embankment, and we were soon in sight of the pier. Unfortunately, we then realised that there was a running race between us and actually being able to use it!\nWe walked to Westminster, where there is an underpass to get past the course. A bit of confusion followed as to exactly where to go and how to buy tickets (no a Travelcard doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover it, but in hindsight it looks like we could have had a 1/3 off). After we\u0026rsquo;d bought the tickets and were feeling committed, we checked the timetable and found that the journey was a bit longer than we expected (about an hour) and the next departure was in 25 mins.\n  Maybe we didn\u0026rsquo;t have so much time as we thought\u0026hellip;\nStill at least the boat was warm with comfortable seats and toilet facilities. With some monitoring of the live tracking while on the boat, we saw that Clare had started the race slightly later than expected and was well on her way by the time we were approaching Greenwich.\nIt was slightly tense, but as we docked it seemed that we had made it to the Cutty Sark ~5 mins ahead of Clare (the tracking showed her arriving at the 10 k mark).\nWe dashed round to the course (the Cutty Sark is very close to the river boat terminal) and took up positions to see Clare arrive.\n  After seeing Clare go past, we then considered where next to pick up the course and how to get there. Seeing long queues for the tube at Greenwich and also queues to cross the course to get to other stations, we decided to join the slightly shorter queue for the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. I had vaguely heard of this tunnel before, but had never used it, so it was mildly exciting to descend the spiral staircase and make our way with the crowds passing though this narrow tube under the river.\n On exiting the tunnel, we took another look at the course map and saw that we were a short walk to mile 16. As it was clear it would still take Clare a bit longer to cover the miles from the Cutty Sark, we started heading towards the course along the Thames Path and looking for somewhere to get lunch.\nWe were glad of the left over pizza from Clare\u0026rsquo;s carb-loading dinner the night before and were starting to wonder if we should have taken more provisions with us; pubs on the route were indeed very busy.\nJust as we were beginning to give up hope, we stumbled across a kebab shop (The Little Kebab House) that had a reassuring number of hygiene stars, so stopped for a short lunch break. While waiting for the food and then while waiting for Clare to arrive, I took the chance to play some whistle tunes to the runners. \u0026lsquo;Banish Misfortune\u0026rsquo; seemed an appropriate choice.\n  At some point, we must have stopped paying full attention to the stream of runners passing us, as suddenly there was Clare waving at us! Hello!\nBy the time we left, the crowds in this area were thinning, and we had a relatively easy time to walk to a station and take the DLR to our next rendezvous point with the course at about mile 23. That would probably be one of the toughest stretches for many of the runners. Hopefully, the cowbells were more encouraging than annoying!\n We made one final trip on the tube to see Clare again at Birdcage Walk about 500 m from the finish and then headed to meeting point M to congratulate her.\n I’ve heard of runners who’ve missed seeing the Cutty Sark, but to me all of London loomed large all day, and I turned the corner round into thunderous noise and these massive masts towering into the sky. It is true as you actually go round the ship in the classic shot you see from the drones on the TV, you can’t see it any longer but, to my delight, I spotted James and my sister dead ahead.\n ©Spotograf.\n  Top tip for spotting supporters is get them to wear something bright – such as a funky bobble hat! My sister, however, had brought a ‘Go Clare’ banner (in hindsight, of course she brought a banner – she’s far too crafty not to have done a banner).\nI did my biggest wave to them… and then proved I was still able to do some running as I set off on a run section when the watch beeped me to go.\nA few more miles of run–walk and some more fun banners (the best I remember were ‘you’ve still got to walk the dog when you finish’, ‘you’re running better than the government’ and ‘I trained all week to hold this banner’) and there’s another alarming bit when you have a section facing towards Canary Wharf and it looks a long long way away, and this is when you know you’re actually still heading away from it.\nKeeping going, keeping running (more or less anyway, I was slightly cutting down on the run durations from 10 miles on) and you start to hear a roar. It’s a sharp right-hand turn (and a freezing gust of wind) and above you is Tower Bridge.\nI don’t really have the words. Just oooooooooo.\nOoooooo.\n ©Spotograf.\n  It’s such an impressive structure; it’s so familiar from the postcards, but yet so not familiar as you approach those tower entrances from straight on. I think it is fair to say it is a goosebumps moment that I got to run over it. I just about remembered to wave for the official cameras!\nExiting Tower Bridge takes you onwards towards the halfway mark. Here, the route runs parallel to runners a long way ahead (at mile 22 – at my pace that meant those runners on for ~4:30). This means you are hit by a spectacular cacophony from excited spectators. (I understand some NHRRs did spot me from the other side; although I’m sorry I didn’t pick out your specific cheers, the combined effect was certainly something, so believe me it all helps you to keep going!).\n ©Spotograf.\n  A more-peaceful bit spectating wise followed, as I approached mile 16; in terms of London landmarks, we shall call this area ‘the kebab shop’. Where despite no barriers, I had to shout “hello, HELLLLLO” to get James to spot me 👋. A brief pause for a photo; not too long in case I couldn’t get going again.\nThe next landmark was also one I suspect most don’t appreciate – passing the green wave’s 7:30 pacer. Realistically, this meant I knew that worry about not making the cut off hadn\u0026rsquo;t been necessary. One of those pacers was dancing and encouraging everyone around them with a lot of enthusiasm, which was really nice too.\nAround mile 18 was where I had a wobble, as I just found myself feeling a little dizzy and cold (rain threatened and I definitely felt a few drops). The physiology of someone at my pace isn’t the same as those that might usually find themselves ‘hitting the wall’, and in retrospect I think it was more just feeling it from having to concentrate quite hard (on where you are putting your feet) while continuously moving. After I slowed the walk down, and ate something, I felt fine again. And it didn’t actually ever rain.\n ©Spotograf.\n  Through Canary Wharf and into Poplar; it was quiet enough now that people did specifically cheer me by name and it is nice that people make the effort to stay out for those running slower paces (I refused the Mars bar someone offered though!). Plus, I should mention the marvellous musicians – a particular highlight was the group of large drums being played in an underpass making the beat reverberate so much you could almost feel it.\nThen it’s Rainbow row; I’m not really sure that the person taking a pint from the crowd really deserved such a massive cheer, but the lively atmosphere sure is one to experience. Another fabulous band playing a (highly amped) traditional folk jig (or perhaps a reel) made me think of James’s tin whistle efforts.\nBack to Embankment and into the furthest I’ve ever run.\nI was in general running out of energy, and there wasn’t a lot of run happening in my run sections by now (not totally none though). I also had a problem I’d (thankfully) never had in training – blisters on the sole of my foot meaning it was painful every time my right foot hit the ground. There might have been a moment wistfully thinking of the very fancy shoes I don\u0026rsquo;t have.\nKeep walking, keep moving. And counting it down in kilometres, not miles, so the brain understands we are still going.\nThen I caught up with my supporters again. By this point, James was able to trot along for a bit ringing his cowbells, “a parkrun to go”. I told him, walking now for me! No trotting. My colleague Sara (a member of Royston Runners) was also a little further along – I was able to smile and wave, but her photos are clearly of me looking quite tired.\n ©Spotograf.\n  Big Ben, and it chimes for 17:45. Not long to go, yet so very long a mile. Saving energy so maybe, just maybe, I might be able to run a little on The Mall. A little glint as the sun, which made a weak appearance, catches on Victoria monument (you don’t see Buckingham Palace from the racers’ angle). Air horns. Trot–walk. A little run, walk, walk, walk; I see the finish line… best make sure to run…\n ©Spotograf.\n  Just after 6pm and I’m across (I’ll have to forgive the BBC for cutting off the live finishing line cameras a minute before I got there as I did appear in a clip in the main 1-hour highlight, but really football punditry…). However, you do get this if you buy the photos so, here\u0026rsquo;s the moment:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.  Medals, yeaaah. 🏅🎉🏆\n Foil blankets and baggage too, and shuffle off to meet James et al. at point ‘M’ to show my medal off. Although, if you\u0026rsquo;d actually seen me at that moment, you\u0026rsquo;d have just been amused at my strangely stiff efforts to retrieve the roll of tape that had escaped my bag and rolled away while putting on my jumper.\n Home, fast food and sleep. So four years late. But I got there. And yes, as you’ve probably realised, given I gave the punchline at the start, it was ~15 mins faster than I possibly could have expected, so I was very pleased with that.\nPost race Some stats: average pace, 9:12 min/km; fastest kilometres, 1 (adrenaline) and 5 (downhill); slowest kilometres, 20 (a stop), 26 (kebab shop photos), 37 and 38 (very tired). Position: 51,622. Ratio of walk to run by time: 1.8 (and I make that about equal by distance). See full GPS tracking on my Strava activity (public, but you need an account), although I do note it does indeed go off the real course at Canary Wharf.\n Graph of distance run over the past few weeks according to Strava. Recovery mode this week!\n  I’ve been asked whether I enjoyed it and demurred at the time. But I think my answer overall, is yes; yes, I did enjoy it. And as to whether I would I do a marathon again. No. It just takes too much out of me; I’m fairly sure I nearly tore a calf muscle again this year, and my Achilles would not have been up to carrying on much longer at all than I did either.\nThere’s still an opportunity to try and improve those few seconds necessary for a first official time in the half of under 3 hours though 😉.\nMeanwhile, I am very lucky to have had a week off work to recover, and do not seem to have any hurts that won\u0026rsquo;t get better in a few weeks (that\u0026rsquo;s not claiming I got out of PJs on the 22nd). And as a treat (no post-marathon blues), I was able to spend two nights somewhere with a hot tub.\nThe fluffy oversized hoodie-type thing my sister bought me with \u0026lsquo;recovery mode\u0026rsquo; on has been put to good use.\nImage gallery                                          Extra shots  How a group looks after London marathon runners not making the official finish times\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-68876566 Bad things that happen while running a marathon\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/19/experience-i-was-attacked-by-a-bear-while-running-a-marathon The story of the Stevenage \u0026lsquo;cool\u0026rsquo; runner\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-68870964 Just one of the many stories of those who do a marathon despite serious illness\nhttps://www.4barsrest.com/news/60651/interview-with-nathaniel-dye On writing about marathons and cliches (sorry, I know I have a few in this)\nhttps://dumbrunner.com/news-blog/2023/10/12/dumb-runner-illustrated-92-shattered   Credits Official photos from the London marathon are marked ©Spotograf and are used with permission.

That is, I finally completed the London marathon 21st April 2024, with a time of 6:33:02. Oh my gosh, has this ever been a lot of hard work – I’ve effectively trained for it three times after first the delays of the pandemic pushed it into 2023, then injury meaning I had to defer to 2024.

However, I\u0026rsquo;ve done my training plan and done my best, even if it exhausted me throughout March (culminating in me having to get the bus to work after being far too stiff to do any commuting by bike), and am more than looking forward to hereafter only doing running that\u0026rsquo;s just a bit more within my ability (parkrun or my club\u0026rsquo;s First Saturday on the Month 5k on Norton Common anyone?).\n As per 2023, I did the Cambridge half as a training race. About a minute slower than last year, but I\u0026rsquo;ll put that down to the stones from the gravel path on the new route through Trinity College getting in my shoes.\n  For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know the story, a TL;DR is I got a ballot place for the London marathon 2020; then when that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen, I transferred to 2022, and when that moved to autumn, transferred again to 2023 (avoiding summer training 🥵 and a certain wedding). However, in March 2023, I tore a calf muscle at mile 16 of a 17-mile training run, and had to defer.\nSo, here we are, only 4 years late. For more musings on it all, and a few detours into other running stuff, see other blog entries tagged with London marathon.\nAlthough my place for London is a ballot place, I am taking this opportunity to do a little fundraising for our local hospice, Garden House Hospice, which I go past on my training runs, and for anyone that would like to donate in support of my efforts, a link is below.\nhttps://www.justgiving.com/page/clare-hooley-london2024\n Garden House Hospice do marvellous work providing end-of-life care and support to patients and their families, and I know the money raised will make a difference to their work. This was also the North Herts Road Runners (NHRR) charity of the year for 2019/2020, when I was originally supposed to be running, and with events cancelled that year, many charities found their income reduced, so it feels fitting.\nTo all the coaches at NHRR who have helped so much over the years of me training for this, know that I am beyond grateful; there\u0026rsquo;s been some memorable evening sessions every March where you\u0026rsquo;ve given up your time to encourage us through those downpours while standing there getting drenched yourself!\nFor those at my work, who\u0026rsquo;ve had to suffer through me going on and on about never-ending training as it once again took over my free time (and strange squeaks when I\u0026rsquo;ve had to get up out my office chair with quads that don\u0026rsquo;t quite work as they usually do), in way of compensation, I\u0026rsquo;ll bring you some marathon cookies. In fact, this is a recipe you\u0026rsquo;ve seen before, as it\u0026rsquo;s just my favourite chocolate cookie recipe, but we do call them \u0026lsquo;marathon cookies\u0026rsquo; in our house as we first made them for James\u0026rsquo;s colleagues when he did the London marathon in 2014.\nMarathon cookies Makes ten.\nIngredients  100 g butter, softened 125 g light brown sugar Yolk from 1 medium egg 125 g plain flour 30 g cocoa powder 0.5 tsp bicarbonate of soda 100 g bar dark chocolate, roughly chopped 60 g pecan nuts, chopped  Directions  Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolk, then sift in the flour, cocoa and bicarbonate of soda and mix well. Add the chopped chocolate and nuts. Chill the mixture while the oven heats up to 170°C (fan). Divide the mixture into ten and roll each portion into a ball. Arrange spaced apart on two lined baking sheets and then press them to flatten them to ~1.5cm thick. Bake for 10–12 mins until risen and cracked but still a bit soft and gooey.   I think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to \u0026lsquo;congratulate\u0026rsquo; myself on having a good deal of stubbornness to get through all the on-offs with marathon training and various associated injuries, but the race will still be hard going and I will be taking a looong time to finish. I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing a lot of walking; mostly walking in fact.\nFor anyone following along on live tracking, I don\u0026rsquo;t start until ~11:20 (bib number 65199), and don\u0026rsquo;t worry if the pace trails off dramatically in the latter stages – it\u0026rsquo;s expected that at some point I will run out of run. It\u0026rsquo;s certainly not true, as you sadly sometimes see trolls claiming, that those walking and taking 8 h haven\u0026rsquo;t trained; it\u0026rsquo;s just our best isn\u0026rsquo;t that fast because 26.2 miles is a very long way and we weren\u0026rsquo;t starting our training from the same point as others.\nMeanwhile, please do also follow my short-form marathon posts on social media (Mastodon; no ads/login/tracking), where James will be doing updates on the day. Replies and encouragement, and boosts, from those on the fediverse are very welcome.\nI hope to write a full report of what I make of the day itself in the week after the event – but it won\u0026rsquo;t be up that promptly.

Maybe washing your brushes if you’re painting, figuring out code if you’re blogging, weighing the ingredients if you’re baking (endless washing if you’re running?). With making paper planners, it’s the dating, printing, cutting and punching.\nDesigning your layout is fun; adding the stickers and writing in your plans or journalling is fun. Dating, printing, cutting and punching, just uggg. So anything that can make your life easier there is definitely a massive win.\nBack when I (Clare) was last talking about my making my 2022 planner, I had a design where each week went over two spreads, with the first spread being specific to each week (i.e. containing calendars and dates), and the second spread being generic and repeated each week. However, since then, I’ve simplified things and now want to print a planner with only one spread per week.\nThe trouble is this means every page of the planner is unique, and then, unless you have a duplex printer that does ‘booklet printing’, or you print on paper already at the size of your final planner (neither of which is true for me), you can’t simply make the planner pages in the order you eventually will have your pages. For each of my A4 sheets of paper, I need the four A5 planner pages to go in the order - front left, page 4; front right, page 1; back left, page 2; back right, page 3.\nThis is definitely more clear with a diagram:\n So there’s a chore before you even get to the printing - re-ordering your pages, by hand. This is extra tedious, and very error prone as you lose your place as you’re going along, and have to try and work out what’s on the back of what - probably more than once.\nSo I had to ask James to step in here with a script. One that didn’t just add the dates to my design but also ordered the pages; however, before we could actually get onto the writing and using of such a script, we needed templates for my actual design that would work for that.\nMaking the SVG planner templates As my final planner is A5, creating the templates as A5 pages (well a little bit smaller than A5 to allow for a margin), rather than as A4 spreads, is much more flexible given that it means pages can be reordered easily if e.g. more page styles need to be added in the future.\nThen page design is separated from the ordering of the pages into the overall planner (i.e. we don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about whether the page will be on the left or right side at the point we design the template).\nAt the moment, I only have three A5 page styles that are repeated for the year:\n an A5 monthly summary that always becomes a right-hand page - dated elements are a month calendar grid and the name of the month an A5 left-hand week page - this also has a month calendar and a header saying what week it is an A5 right-hand page that has a header with the date and a dated box for each day of the week  A rough sketch (page 1 is on the back of page 2) on this is below:\n The first three pages of the planner as it would be for 2023. Page 4 would be a repeat of page 2 but for week 2 and so on.\n  All the pages are in the SVG vector format - they are created in Inkscape. However, what you don\u0026rsquo;t see when looking at SVGs in graphics software is they are actually just text (xml), with that text describing various aspects of the images in a well-documented way (see e.g. this mdn tutorial).\nBecause the files are text, it is then easy to use simple scripts to modify them through a find-and-replace strategy.\nSo the next step is, instead of having \u0026lsquo;January\u0026rsquo; etc., to use placeholder \u0026lsquo;strings\u0026rsquo; for all the dated elements (circled in red in diagram above) that need to be changed each week. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important that the strings chosen don\u0026rsquo;t occur elsewhere in the SVG, so to reduce the chance of matching something not intended, we used the convention (inspired by the python string format syntax) of enclosing the items to replace in curly braces.\n Example A5 template before the find-replace\n  One extra issue is that the number of rows in the month calendar grids varies depending on the number of weeks in the month, which means the geometry of the surrounding elements needs to be tweaked to accommodate that.\nTo overcome this, in the case of the month summary, we have made three templates for each of the three options (months can extend over 4, 5 or 6 weeks). This works OK for now, but isn\u0026rsquo;t the easiest to maintain as any updates need to be made on all three copies. The other template with a calender grid has an area that is an OK size to just about allow for the 6-week grid.\nOnce, you have your templates, you then need the script to run on them. The rest of the post explains the script to the world, just in case anyone else can be inspired by it.\nAutomating the planner creation Intended audience: we hope non-technical readers should be able to follow the thinking behind the code steps. To follow the details and update the script for a new planner style, you\u0026rsquo;d need to know a little python.\n To automate the repetitive parts of replacing the placeholder values with the appropriate date information for each month, and ordering the A5 pages into A4 spreads, I (James) wrote a Python script.\nThe planner generation script:\n performs a find-and-replace on the date-related elements to create all the A5 individual SVG pages for a year combines the A5 page SVGs into A4 SVGs creates a PDF from the SVGs that can be sent to a standard single-sided A4 printer without further intervention  Code for each step is described below.\n1. Create a year\u0026rsquo;s worth of A5 SVGs The script works through the weeks in the year creating each of the A5 SVGs in the order that they will appear in the finished planner. For each page, it picks the appropriate template, does the find-replace and writes the resulting file.\nSome of the replacements need to be updated each time the script creates the pages for a new week, others (e.g. the replacements for the calendar grid) are the same for a whole month. As the script steps through the weeks, it identifies when it has reached the start of a new month and updates the per-month replacements before generating the start of month pages.\nDetermining what values to use for the replacements needs to take into account the calendar for the year. For example, we need to figure out which month each week is in and what dates correspond to each day of the week. Fortunately, the python standard library includes the datetime module, which is used to take care of much of the work of dealing with dates. This leaves us free to forget about the rhyme for remembering the number of days in each month and whether or not it\u0026rsquo;s a leap year.\nThe following snippet shows how the script determines the replacements for a calendar grid of a given month. It creates a date object representing the first day of the month and subtracts the appropriate number of days to find the first day of the grid, which is the Monday of the first week (e.g. if the first of the month is a Wednesday it subtracts 2 days). Then it loops over the 42 grid positions advancing the date by 1 day each time it goes through the loop. In each case, it can check if this date is within the month (dates at the start and end of the grid can be in the preceding or following months) and if so, set up the replacement with the correct the day of the month.\n# Setup replacements for calendar grid. SVG templates contain grids like # M T W T F S S # {1} {2} {3} {4} {5} {6} {7} # ... # {36} {37} {38} {39} {40} {41} {42} # # These replacements are used to replace the days of the month (or empty string # if the day is outside the current month) # We will want to know the number of weeks in the month. Use this set to keep # track of them. weeks_in_month = set() # Iterate over the 42 days starting from first day in the grid first_day_of_month = datetime.date(year,month,1) first_day_of_grid = first_day_of_month - datetime.timedelta(days=first_day_of_month.isocalendar().weekday - 1) for day in range(0,42): date = first_day_of_grid + datetime.timedelta(days=day) if date.month != month: # replace dates that are outside current month with empty string template_page_manager.replacements[\u0026#39;{\u0026#39;+ str(day+1) + \u0026#39;}\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; else: template_page_manager.replacements[\u0026#39;{\u0026#39;+ str(day+1) + \u0026#39;}\u0026#39;] = str(date.day) weeks_in_month.add(date.isocalendar().week) Similar code is used for the other placeholder replacements.\n2. Create combined A4 SVG pages To create the A4 spreads for printing, we wanted to arrange two of the A5 pages side by side to form the A4 page. The easiest way I found to do that was to create an SVG that referred to each of the A5 pages using an internal SVG image tag.\nWhen combining them to form an A4 spread, padding is added to position the templates approximately centrally within each half of the spread.\nStarting at the beginning, you take four pages at a time and use those to create two A4 SVGs optionally reordering the pages as shown above to put the 4th and 1st page on the front and 2nd and 3rd pages on the back (i.e. the arrangement shown in top diagram above). That part is taken care of by the following code:\nif args.reorder: # Reorder pages for printing  first_a4_right = a5_pages.pop(0) second_a4_left = a5_pages.pop(0) second_a4_right = a5_pages.pop(0) first_a4_left = a5_pages.pop(0) else: # Leave pages in order first_a4_left = a5_pages.pop(0) first_a4_right = a5_pages.pop(0) second_a4_left = a5_pages.pop(0) second_a4_right = a5_pages.pop(0) For each of the A4 spreads, the script generates a rather minimal SVG file containing only the two A5 SVG images plus a couple of short lines that we wanted to mark the centreline of the spread to aid trimming. The contents of one of these SVGs looks like this:\n\u0026lt;svg version=\u0026#34;1.1\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;297mm\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;210mm\u0026#34; xmlns=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;image x=\u0026#34;5.5mm\u0026#34; y=\u0026#34;5mm\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;135mm\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;200mm\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;../../planner_files_2023/a5_pages/002_week_pad_week1.svg\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;image x=\u0026#34;156.5mm\u0026#34; y=\u0026#34;5mm\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;135mm\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;200mm\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;../../planner_files_2023/a5_pages/003_week_daylist_week1.svg\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;line x1=\u0026#34;50%\u0026#34; x2=\u0026#34;50%\u0026#34; y1=\u0026#34;90%\u0026#34; y2=\u0026#34;91%\u0026#34; stroke=\u0026#34;black\u0026#34; stroke-width=\u0026#34;0.5\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;line x1=\u0026#34;50%\u0026#34; x2=\u0026#34;50%\u0026#34; y1=\u0026#34;9%\u0026#34; y2=\u0026#34;10%\u0026#34; stroke=\u0026#34;black\u0026#34; stroke-width=\u0026#34;0.5\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; This SVG isn\u0026rsquo;t generated using a template, but directly written by the following python function:\n# Function to create an A4 svg that includes to two 135 by 200 mm (slightly smaller than A5) # pages as svg images: def write_a4_svg(left_a5, right_a5, a4_filename): with open(a4_filename,\u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) as output_svg: output_svg.write(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;svg version=\u0026#34;1.1\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;297mm\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;210mm\u0026#34; xmlns=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#39;) if left_a5 is not None: output_svg.write(f\u0026#39;\u0026lt;image x=\u0026#34;5.5mm\u0026#34; y=\u0026#34;5mm\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;135mm\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;200mm\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;../../{left_a5}\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#39;) if right_a5 is not None: output_svg.write(f\u0026#39;\u0026lt;image x=\u0026#34;156.5mm\u0026#34; y=\u0026#34;5mm\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;135mm\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;200mm\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;../../{right_a5}\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#39;) # Add two short lines to mark the centerline to aid cutting output_svg.write(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;line x1=\u0026#34;50%\u0026#34; x2=\u0026#34;50%\u0026#34; y1=\u0026#34;90%\u0026#34; y2=\u0026#34;91%\u0026#34; stroke=\u0026#34;black\u0026#34; stroke-width=\u0026#34;0.5\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#39;) output_svg.write(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;line x1=\u0026#34;50%\u0026#34; x2=\u0026#34;50%\u0026#34; y1=\u0026#34;9%\u0026#34; y2=\u0026#34;10%\u0026#34; stroke=\u0026#34;black\u0026#34; stroke-width=\u0026#34;0.5\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#39;) output_svg.write(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#39;) Which is called once for each of the A4 spreads:\na4_filename = (os.path.join(template_page_manager.a4_svgs_dir, f\u0026#39;{a4_num:03d}.svg\u0026#39;)) a4_svg_files.append(a4_filename) write_a4_svg(left_a5=first_a4_left, right_a5=first_a4_right, a4_filename=a4_filename) a4_num += 1 a4_filename = (os.path.join(template_page_manager.a4_svgs_dir, f\u0026#39;{a4_num:03d}.svg\u0026#39;)) a4_svg_files.append(a4_filename) write_a4_svg(left_a5=second_a4_left, right_a5=second_a4_right, a4_filename=a4_filename) a4_num += 1 Note that for general use, this seems a bit clunky as this SVG requires the image SVGs to be in the correct relative locations. It might be easier to manage if everything were combined into a single file. Probably that could be achieved by combining elements from the SVGs into a single file and using the \u0026lt;use\u0026gt; element to arrange them. For our use case, this simple way using image is OK as the next step is to convert these SVG files into PDFs\u0026hellip;\n3. Creating the final PDF For printing, we wanted to convert these SVG files into PDF to make them portable for printing. We also wanted combine all the A4 PDFs into a single multipage file to make the printing process less tedious.\nTo do this, we used external tools (run from the script using the python subprocess module). There are probably many other options that could work, but we used CairoSVG for the conversion and Ghostscript for combining PDFs.\nConvert all the A4 SVGs into PDFs using cairosvg:\nfor a4_svg in a4_svg_files: a4_pdf = os.path.basename(a4_svg)[0:-3] + \u0026#39;pdf\u0026#39; a4_pdf = os.path.join(template_page_manager.a4_pdfs_dir,a4_pdf) a4_pdf_files.append(a4_pdf) cmd = f\u0026#39;cairosvg -o {a4_pdf}{a4_svg}\u0026#39; logging.debug(f\u0026#34;Executing command: {cmd}\u0026#34;) subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True) This processes each SVG using commands like:\ncairosvg -o planner_files_2023/a4_pdfs/004.pdf planner_files_2023/a4_svgs/004.svg Create a final output by merging all these PDFs into a single file using Ghostscript:\nmerged_pdf_file = os.path.join(template_page_manager.year_dir,f\u0026#39;merged_year_{year}.pdf\u0026#39;) cmd = f\u0026#39;gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dAutoRotatePages=/None -sOutputFile={merged_pdf_file}{\u0026#34; \u0026#34;.join(a4_pdf_files)}\u0026#39; logging.debug(f\u0026#34;Executing command: {cmd}\u0026#34;) subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True) The command run here is something like:\ngs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dAutoRotatePages=/None -sOutputFile=planner_files_2023/merged_year_2023.pdf planner_files_2023/a4_pdfs/001.pdf planner_files_2023/a4_pdfs/002.pdf planner_files_2023/a4_pdfs/003.pdf planner_files_2023/a4_pdfs/004.pdf ... planner_files_2023/a4_pdfs/064.pdf For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, in principle Inkscape itself could be used in a command line mode to create the PDFs. However, on my system, opening files from the command line with Inkscape seems broken (probably due to this known issue).\n Final PDF after find and replace and combining pages\n  In case they\u0026rsquo;re useful to anyone wanting to do something similar, the complete script (under an MIT license) and templates (under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 license) are available at:\n https://github.com/moomop/planner-generator\n Making your own planner As planner layouts are quite personal, these scripts are\u0026rsquo;t very configurable (e.g. we\u0026rsquo;re only working with a Monday-start week, being from the UK), but if you were thinking of trying the same for your own layout, you\u0026rsquo;d first create templates with whatever art, dot grids and fonts etc. you want with in SVG format, and then tweak the find-and-replace done by the script.\nIt would also be possible to update the script to add extra templates (e.g. say you want 3 or 4 pages per week or an end of month retrospective page).\nGotchas and future improvements While following this flow, I found a few oddities when viewing the Inkscape-created SVGs in other programs (I tried browsers such as firefox/chrome as well as cairosvg for converting into PDF).\nAlthough in principle SVG is a standard, so should look the same everywhere (assuming these were valid SVGs - I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually check), I found that some elements could fail to show or display slightly differently in some viewers.\nRather than fully investigate those, I updated the templates by removing and redrawing those elements. Along the way I also found a few duplicated elements in the SVGs. It could be that some of these issues stem from the rather old version of Inkscape that we\u0026rsquo;d used a few years ago to first create some of these SVG drawings.\nIt would definitely be possible to go further and automate more of the geometrical elements of the planner (the dot grids, corner markers etc.) probably using something like drawsvg.\n Extra shots  \u0026lsquo;The Python Tutorial\u0026rsquo; from python.org\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ Inkscape beginners' guide\nhttps://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io  ","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2023/10/planner-date-script/","summary":"With a lot of hobbies, there’s always the bit that’s the chore.

Then, ~2 months ago, coffeenow also joined the fediverse, and now has its own account on Mastodon.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s no doubt that Mastodon is not your standard choice for promoting a blog if your purpose is to drive engagement (here, just using the term to mean getting eyeballs onto your writing), but of course that\u0026rsquo;s not the purpose. We basically just want to offer an option for people to find, follow and interact with our posts in a way outside of RSS.\n Mastodon basics (as we understand them) Mastodon is something that, like many, we became aware of when it started being mentioned as a Twitter alternative - first in 2022, then again more recently as Twitter began imploding into a horrid mess as paid-for \u0026lsquo;blue tick\u0026rsquo; accounts (including many spamming crypto scams or really extremist views) became heavily promoted to users.\nFirst, what it isn\u0026rsquo;t. Mastodon is not (mostly) a social media platform - it is open-source software (AGPL-3.0 license) that allows anyone to run their own social network, on their own server or \u0026lsquo;instance\u0026rsquo;.\nHow that becomes different to an old-school style forum is that each instance then connects to each other via a protocol known as ActivityPub, a standard maintained by the W3C, the same group that do the general web standards. This means, when you log into the Mastodon instance you have joined, you don\u0026rsquo;t only see the stuff on that instance but also stuff \u0026lsquo;federated\u0026rsquo; from other instances, hence you become part of the \u0026lsquo;fediverse\u0026rsquo;.\nAnd, it\u0026rsquo;s not just Mastodon that is part of the fediverse, other platforms - for example, Pixelfed, an Instagram-like network - also use the ActivityPub protocol and can be federated into the network with Mastodon. Thus, via the one account, on the one instance, on the one platform, you can interact with many platforms.\n ©Fedi.Tips. A simplified diagram of connections in the fediverse.\n  A common analogy is to think of Mastodon as a technology in the same way you think about email. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that truly covers it - I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not truly clear on quite how it works in terms of who sees who in all this federated networking.\nWhy Mastodon So if the fediverse isn\u0026rsquo;t one thing, why have we chosen Mastodon and how have we chosen the instance we have versus another.\nWell, despite any muddle on my understanding on the in and outs of federation, what I am clear on is that the Mastodon software will show you stuff in your home feed in a true chronological order - there is no algorithm that determines what you see; you choose people (or hashtags) to follow and, hence, you choose who and what appears in your feed.\nAnd - let\u0026rsquo;s shout this out loud - there are no adverts - it\u0026rsquo;s not standardly supported in the Mastodon software (most instances are funded by donations or sponsorships for the server costs - as the user, a lot of instance admins will allow/encourage you to make donations to their costs, and we intend to do just that for the instance we are using).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also no trackers on standard Mastodon websites, something that\u0026rsquo;s very rare to find in any website today, where Google analytics and Facebook pixels are almost universally embedded [that\u0026rsquo;s not to say no data is collected about you when using Mastodon - you still need to read the privacy policy from your instance - but on the whole it\u0026rsquo;s data needed to operate, not hoovering up everything possible to target ads at you].\nSo, if you think the above is something you believe in, and it for us, then Mastodon is really a great choice.\nFediverse oddities Despite all the positivity above, life in the fediverse isn\u0026rsquo;t without oddities.\nIn terms of what you actually see, of course, like any social network, there are bad apples, and even the human-led moderation you get in Mastodon can\u0026rsquo;t remove it all.\nThe technology is also not always quite as smooth as you might be used to. I\u0026rsquo;d certainly recommend downloading a third-party app if you want a few of the more important website features on your phone (e.g. Ice Cubes on iOS). Or to have replies below the original post!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also a bit weird to see exceptionally high levels of non-sensitive stuff hidden behind content warnings. For me, there\u0026rsquo;s a level of \u0026lsquo;boy who cried wolf\u0026rsquo; about it, although others find it a positive in terms of keeping feeds uncluttered.\nFinally, yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard Mastodon described as \u0026ldquo;the nerdy network\u0026rdquo;; I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s data to truly back that up because Mastodon doesn\u0026rsquo;t collect it, but, as an example, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure a poll on TikTok, Twitter or Facebook would turn up 60% of respondents saying \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;I have edited a Wikipedia article\u0026rsquo;! Or if it did, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it.\n But, having decided on Mastodon, you need to decide on your instance. Although these days, somewhat controversially, the Mastodon sign up process directs you to try @mastodon.social, that\u0026rsquo;s not where we are.\nDespite some arguments that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t much matter which instance you choose to join (and it\u0026rsquo;s true you can always move instances - taking your followers with you), our experience is that it probably does, or it least it does if you browse your \u0026lsquo;local\u0026rsquo; timeline (containing all posts by instance members) or follow hashtags.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because of the way federation works - although technically everyone is connected to everyone else in the fediverse (apart from those that are blocked by your instance), if you see everyone, you see an awful lot of noise. Conversely, your experience might be quite isolated if you only are part of a very small group.\nFederation of Threads Right now, there is much talk centred around the launch of the Threads app, a very-Twitter-like platform run by Meta/Instagram, and what the consequences are if Threads federates using ActivityPub, as Meta have stated is their intention.\nA huge commercial player like this federating has two obvious issues.\n are the sort of numbers we\u0026rsquo;re talking about going to drive server costs for small instances so high they become unviable? can Meta be trusted not to destroy Mastodon through an \u0026lsquo;embrace, extend and extinguish\u0026rsquo; (EEE) strategy?  Having said above, this is not the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve heard disquiet about how the views of those running very large Mastodon instances, including those run by Mastodon itself (although these are not anywhere near the scale of Threads), could drive the narrative for everyone. There are also questions about the scalability of Mastodon in general.\nMastodon addresses their stance on Threads on their blog, but this is definitely not universally accepted, and many instances are planning on suspending federation with Threads, at least for the foreseeable future.\n Instances typically have a primary focus; perhaps art, science or tech. For us, we simply chose a generalist, but truly UK-based instance (by that I mean the hardware running the instance is based in the UK, not just the majority of users). It\u0026rsquo;s worth mentioning, the instance admins are also the ones who decide on moderation policies - but as a first rule, any instance with a link on the Mastodon picker does have to sign up to the Mastodon covenant.\nAs it happened, we got round to setting up our Mastodon account not long after the previous post, on the London marathon, went out, and until we get this post up, that all that\u0026rsquo;s on the account (we haven\u0026rsquo;t been reposting):\n  Oh, and if it anyone\u0026rsquo;s wondering, embedding posts from Mastodon is very easy, just a click and copy for some html, but in the IceCubes app, it\u0026rsquo;s also easy to click a few dots and you get an image of a post, which is just a bit more future-proof - Twitter stopped their feed API last week, and although we never used it here, right now, there\u0026rsquo;s a whole load of websites/blogs/apps (including public service channels) with broken feed boxes showing no content, so image it is.\nPlease feel free to follow and chat with us at @coffeenow@mastodon.me.uk.\nOur personal Mastodon microblogs After a bit of experimenting with Mastodon for an account for this blog, both James and I have now taken the plunge and got ourselves Mastodon accounts for more general social media pottering - while Threads might have its 100 million, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty more who still haven\u0026rsquo;t abandoned Twitter, and Bluesky is growing, I\u0026rsquo;ve tended to find there\u0026rsquo;s still lots of posts that are interesting/amusing enough on Mastodon.\n Banner logo for Clare\u0026rsquo;s account - trying to be clever representing content on Mastodon vs content on the blog.\n  Our accounts aren\u0026rsquo;t for stuff we intend to keep forever - it\u0026rsquo;s just sometimes you might want to share your photo of a cake or cat, or your friend\u0026rsquo;s cake or cat, or write a report on a running race without that being enough content to be worth writing a full blog post for.\nFor any one wanting to follow us, please do:\n @clare_hooley@mastodon.me.uk @james_keogh@mastodon.me.uk  Posts are likely to be up for a few months before being deleted.

I think I’ve always been clear that there was a bit of an ‘if’ getting to the start line. When you are pushing yourself doing runs that are that far, and far further than you’ve done before (although, well, it actually went wrong at the same distance as the longest I got to in 2020), there’s always a risk of picking up an injury.\n Finding appropriate stickers for my journal\n  And at 16 out 17 miles in said going-wrong run, I managed to tear my calf muscle. Which usually takes at least 4 weeks to heal. Because after 2 weeks of full rest (this was 3 weeks before the marathon), it still wasn’t healed enough to run, I decided to defer my place - it’s fairly silly trying to run a marathon when you have an injury at the start, even though some pain at the end is only to be expected.\nSo we’re still much where we were last year, with a now 4-year marathon attempt. However, that’s not to say there haven’t been some successes since I last was humming and hawing on it all in August 21, so here\u0026rsquo;s me picking up the thread of that from the time training restarted in autumn.\nAutumn 2022 to March 2023 When starting to work towards marathon training, you hear talk about building a base; well building a base for me meant a heck of a lot more walking in my runs than ever before.\nI did the first race I’d done in years in November (the Bonfire Burn, as reviewed in a previous post) with about a third of it walking (and another kilometre where it was pure mud, so more slipping around than even walking), but it soon became apparent that for me to get anywhere near to the distances necessary to think of pulling off a marathon, it needed even more walking than that. Especially when there were any even any minor gradients to “puff you to a standstill”.\nIn order to get a more realistic feel of where things were, and as motivation, more races/group training runs were planned. After the Bonfire Burn, it was the Hatfield 5 miles at the end of November, the first of Gade Valley\u0026rsquo;s marathon training runs in late Feb (12 miles), the Cambridge half in early March and finally the second Gade Valley run (17 miles) in late March.\n By the time James was sprinting for the line, I was ~5 miles in\n  It was as hard as you might expect starting from quite a bit behind where I’d been in 2019/2020, and of course, despite my best efforts, there were other setbacks. After avoiding it for 3 years, I got COVID-19 for the first time in January 23 (if summer training is horrible because of hot days - “rum, not run” - then winter training has the disadvantage of more chance of the sniffles). That took me out for 3 weeks, meaning there was a bit of a ridiculous leap as the longest training run went from 8 miles straight up to the 12 miles of Gade Valley I.\nThen a true race - the Cambridge half. I know I encouraged James to enter too, to keep him entertained while I completed it, but I’d not quite realised that the wave starts would mean he’d be literally half way round before I’d even started!\nTechnically, as I’ve never done an official half before, it was a pb for me, although of course it was quite a bit slower than I’d run the distance in 2020. However, it was also the first race I’d been in with anything like this number of competitors and supporters. Even for me in the tail at the back (although surprisingly far from actually last) there were a fair few ‘crowds’ cheering out on the course right the way round.\nAnd on that note, I should say the day itself was super cold, ~3°C, not cold enough to be a problem running, but certainly very cold for the two people who stayed out the whole time necessary to cheer not only the super speedy North Herts Road Runners (NHRR) members (there were plenty of those finishing \u0026lt;1 h 30 min, even James!) but also those in the just over 3 hours run-walk (I was by then doing 50% walking by time), any speed as long as we get round it within the time limit, category. Thank you to them.\n Round King\u0026rsquo;s college\n  I’ve heard people say how there\u0026rsquo;s a section in the middle of the Cambridge half that’s boring as it’s just on a country road in the middle of a flat nowhere - well, as it happened, I didn’t have a boring ‘boring bit’ because that was the section I was running alongside, and actually very slowly overtaking, Mr Ovary, who was doing a fabulous job in a very difficult costume (it wouldn’t have allowed you to use your arms).\n Finally made it: 3 h 00 min 14 s\n  After the race, I told myself ‘no, I wouldn’t feel tempted do a half again’, even despite it not being unlikely that I could find the extra minute\u0026rsquo;s speed to get the time to under 3 h (i.e. when it would be Ok to push it more at the end because you could rest rather than go straight back into training the week after!), but we’ll come back to that thought later.\nTwo weeks later was Gade Valley II, a 17-mile training run. It’s a lot harder route than Cambridge, as it’s not flat by any stretch of the imagination, and I won’t lie by saying I wasn’t feeling training aches before I started it. By that stage, quite a number of my regular Tuesday NHRR club sessions had degenerated into run-walks for only 30 mins, or perhaps 20 mins if I were really sore [I owe big thank yous to all those who plan and lead club sessions - Cara, the two Daves, Jo, Karen and Linda (alphabetical order) to name a few - not least, for having to put up with my continual \u0026lsquo;adaptations\u0026rsquo; to the stated plans].\nHowever, despite the niggles, I still didn’t \u0026lsquo;expect\u0026rsquo; the run to go wrong. Although, in actual fact it could have been worse - at ~14 miles, four ginormous deer, complete with very big antlers, burst out the undergrowth 10 m ahead of us and went charging off up the road. My guess is red deer, not fallow deer, and certainly not the Muntjac I’m more used to from Norton Common (although James and I had indeed once had a shock even with \u0026lsquo;just\u0026rsquo; three of those charging across our path).\n...four ginormous deer, complete with very big antlers, burst out the undergrowth 10 m ahead of us  Never have I been more glad of not being a little faster.\nBut it was so near the end that the injury happened - my calf just went pop. I knew it wasn’t a terrible tear owing to the fact I could limp the last mile back to the HQ, but I also knew it was likely to scupper running London.\nAnd so it proved. In early April, I clicked the button to confirm I was withdrawing. But, if that’s the case, then what’s this ‘new running thing’ mentioned in the post title…\nApril 2023 By 4 weeks after I had the injury, things running wise were starting to look up. I could attend some of the club evening training sessions, and start looking towards longer runs on the weekends again.\nBut for a bit of motivation to maintain at least some of the effect of this winter\u0026rsquo;s training for later in the year, I decided to enter another half in October. And apparently it\u0026rsquo;s even flatter than Cambridge - which you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think would be possible! So role on my next challenge, the Great Eastern Run - I do not promise under 3 h though [note from the future, problems with my Achilles meant this couldn\u0026rsquo;t in fact happen]!\n...I was rather afraid of showing myself up as the lumbering elephant  Then, for the rest of April, two club runs that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been possible if I\u0026rsquo;d actually been at the marathon. The first of these was my very first time on a running track.\nThe running club often has a extra Saturday session, held jointly with Fairlands Valley Spartans, at a track in Stevenage. Now track sessions evoke memories of (bad) school sports lessons, in rutted grass, and hadn\u0026rsquo;t been on my list of things to try.\n Track mode makes a gps trace show nice perfect ovals, but isn\u0026rsquo;t much good if you set it up wrong!\n  It also tends to be the fastest (keenest?) members of the club that attend these sessions; to me they look like elegant springboks, whereas I was rather afraid of showing myself up as the lumbering elephant getting in the way. As it turned out coach Karen was very reassuring on that - in the list of track etiquette points (e.g. warm up in the outside lanes clockwise, run in the inner lane anti-clockwise) it was clear enough fast and slow runners could be ok together - well at least for training!\nNot withstanding issues using my gps watch\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;track mode\u0026rsquo; [(a) I managed to set up as if I were in the outside lane the whole time and (b) didn\u0026rsquo;t realise you needed to say don\u0026rsquo;t autopause again in a different place to where I\u0026rsquo;d already done that for normal running], which meant the distances/paces calculated were all wonky, it was a fun hour doing something quite different.\nSpringy, flat surfaces are rather nice on the calf muscles.\n Spring in Oughtonhead common\n  Then, we had the annual \u0026lsquo;bird run\u0026rsquo;. We are very lucky to have someone very good at ornithology in the club, and who kindly gives up his time on an annual event to lead us round a run to spot (or hear) the birds at Oughtonhead Common.\nLast time I went on this, I remember lots of swallows and house martins on a rather soggy day; this year was perfect spring weather with skylarks, blackcaps (doing lots of song), the first swift of the year, some goldcrests, a yellowhammer, a green finch (well that one was only heard) and chiffchaff. And wonderful hosts with a fabulous brunch (I had three scones).\n Jogging off to see the birds\n  So, in other words\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s correct - there are other runs just as rewarding as London marathon, in their own way! Although, that does not mean I won\u0026rsquo;t be giving it my very best to have more success in April 2024.\n Extra shots  Calf tear advice (no stretching, no foam rolling!)\nhttps://www.runnersworld.com/uk/health/injury/a773619/ask-the-physio-calf-tears/   Credits Photos from the Cambridge Half are ©Sussex Sport Photography and are used with permission.\n","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2023/04/not-at-london/","summary":"Ok, so for those who don’t know, the London marathon didn’t happen for me this year.

And, for a lot of people, at this time of year, there’s a renewed focus on fitness goals. This isn’t quite the case for me, as I’ve been training for the three-year marathon (yep, still plan to do it, injury excepting) since the start of October. Not quite training like I managed in 2019 and early 2020 - as you can only start from where you are - but training, nevertheless.\nAs for many runners, and indeed those doing many sports, use of a gps watch to record the locations and times of my activities is now an integral part of my going for a run. However, data collected by such a gadget is only as much use as the meaning you can extract out of it. Unfortunately, the number one app in this market, Strava, really lets me down on data analysis, and, despite its in your face nags, and more and more features being premium only, I won’t subscribe unless they sort out a fundamental change in that aspect.\n Strava is a website/app that acts as a combined fitness social media and a data analysis package. You record an activity either via a third-party gps tracker that you wear (I have an older Garmin watch), via the app itself running on your phone/watch or even manually enter something, upload it to their servers, and it displays a little summary of said activity. This can then be shared to other members of Strava (all members or just followers), which allows them to comment on your activity and give you likes (called ‘kudos’), as validation of how well you’ve done.\nIt’s so ubiquitous out there that the phrase is ‘if it\u0026rsquo;s not on Strava, it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen’.\nIf you pay, and the current price has just shot up to ~£55 a year (pricing isn\u0026rsquo;t very clear for upcoming 2023 renewals), you get access to some competitive features, such as leaderboards for segments (short defined routes), route plotting and more data analysis. But here’s where I don’t get it. Why are people paying for data analysis that is all geared to ‘moving pace’, an algorithm-generated pace, and not at all geared to real pace?\nWhy are people paying for data analysis that is all geared to ‘moving pace’, an algorithm-generated pace…  Real pace is simple; it’s distance travelled divided by time that has passed. I mostly work in kilometres for my running, so I tend to think about my paces in kilometres per minute (km/min). If I stop, say to cross a road or because a stop is actually planned into my training, then time doesn’t stop, but distance does. Real times and paces in Strava are known as ‘elapsed’ times and paces.\nMoving pace is not so simple. Theoretically, the idea of a moving pace is that when you stop, time is paused, so both distance and time stop.\n Real and moving time. A distance-time graph for a session where you are running between points 1 and 2, stopped between points 2 and 3, running between points 3 and 4, and walking between points 4 and 5. Real pace will be the total distance divided by the total time. Moving pace will be the same distance divided by the time not including the time between 2 and 3 (coral arrows).\n  However, let’s think about this in terms of how a gps tracker actually works. It can’t know precisely when you’ve stopped, it has to guess a bit. This means moving time is always a calculated estimate.\n What is the moving time? A speed-time graph for the session in the diagram above. The gps tracker only collects location data at discrete points so software has to \u0026lsquo;decide\u0026rsquo; when you are moving and when you are not, and might or might not remove time in the coral areas depending on if it thinks you are moving or are still.\n  In my experience, Strava, of the several running apps I’ve tried, tends to skew its calculation towards stopping time the most, i.e. it keeps time paused when you’re in fact moving, just moving slowly. This means your moving pace in Strava tends to come out as the highest pace you’re ever going to see.\nOk, all well and good. It’s done consistently, right, so still useful? Indeed, that could be the case, but to me the problem is it’s this calculated moving pace that is the pace Strava chooses to display and share to others as the primary pace in the feed of all your activities.\nSo, you’re trying to have a scroll through your training runs to see how fast you’ve done your sessions, but what it’s showing is all a bit useless. Most training sessions have planned stops (i.e. are some form of interval training), so recording a moving pace for those gives you no idea what you’ve really done; you get silly paces that are way faster than you’d ever do in any other type of session. Once, I even got an overall moving pace that was faster over the whole session than I could sprint at because I’d done a lot of time doing slow walking, time Strava appeared to ‘forget’ existed, while not missing that the distance had moved on.\nIf you do a manual stop of time, this overrides the automatic algorithm stops of time…  I just find my feed showing this inflated pace annoying, and because there’s no option to primarily show real pace (despite it being a pretty popular request in the old Strava forum that’s now no longer on the web), I usually try and remember to make sure I do a workaround when recording my activities.\nYou can do that by manually pausing your watch for just 1 second a couple of times in the run. If you do a manual stop of time, this overrides the automatic algorithm stops of time, and you get a moving time that is close to elapsed time, and an overall moving pace that will be pretty close to real pace. [Note though, it doesn’t retain this if you also crop the activity to e.g. remove the bit when you’re actually in a car, when you’ve forgotten to stop your watch!]\nIt’s just too often, I forget to do the manual pauses, and those activities are just arggggg.\nThankfully, for races you don’t get this problem as you can set a Strava activity as a ‘race’ type. This then also flicks times shown over into real ‘elapsed’ time. And if you try claiming a moving time as your real time for a race, well, then there’s amusement to be had (a highlight of 2020 has to be @Stravaw***ers and the #RossBarkley5km challenge).\n Stickers to mark sessions that were my longest runs during 2020\u0026rsquo;s marathon training\n  As to me, well… if I get to the end of the London Marathon (less than 100 days to go 😱😳), well of course the run will go on Strava (just for fun, not for kudos), but be assured, no moving times as soon as I can practicably switch it over. That’s the purpose of us wearing chips in races, especially as gps is known to go haywire around Canary Wharf when you lose connection to the satellites owing to the tall buildings.\nSo, Strava, for me, it’s only good as social media, not for data analysis. But then what do I find works for data analysis for a very slow, very walking runner - well, more on that will have to wait until the next post, as in fact, I’ve haven’t found anything that does quite as well as using the data to make lap pace graphs.\n...think about where [your data is] stored and if you need to keep a back up.  Finally though, two top tips on tracking runs. One, you aren’t limited to technology, it’s certainly a good/amusing one to record in a paper planner, especially if you have an appropriate sticker, as I always do. Two, if you find your data from gps watches useful, think about where it’s stored and if you need to keep a back up.

Fast forward to 2022, and things aren’t quite so good with the running, but the training for the three-year-plus marathon is back on as I aim to improve enough to somehow make it round the 26.2 miles next April. Hence, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to mix in some training races to give me motivation.\nTherefore, I once again decided to enter the Bonfire Burn 10k, a friendly race run in aid of a local community group. In 2019, I was on my own for the race - I think it clashed with a cross-country that James was at - but this year, we both managed to make it.\nThe race itself is nice and flat, as might be expected for the Cambridge area - and that suited me fine - hills only make you stronger up to the point they puff you to a standstill!\n Made it\u0026hellip;\n  In 2019, you actually started along the road past my office window. This year, however, the route had been adjusted to avoid the need for road closures (I do recall an unimpressed driver as we all milled around blocking the road) and started on the Histon and Impington recreation ground, at the same location as the finish.\nI understand that there were a good 750 entries for the event, but given the hour or two before the race had the rain was coming down in sheets, I’m not surprised the starting numbers were a little down on that. I can only be glad that the rain seemed to ease off a little as the start time approached, because, as the path round the fields at the start is quite narrow, we do start in three waves to space us out a bit, meaning I have a little bit of a wait.\n...hills only make you stronger up to the point they puff you to a standstill!  James being (hopefully) faster than 45 min, means he is asked to go in wave 1, while those at the back of wave 3, like me, start about 10 minutes later.\nI will admit to feeling concerned that this was the furthest I’d actually run in at least a year, but, trying to keep positive, I was hopeful that with a run-walk plan, I could get round in a time that was fair on the volunteer marshalls who would be stood out on the latter bits of the course. (Although I have been solidly training at increasing distance recently, it hasn’t been totally successful.)\nSoon though, we were all off. After a scuttle round the fields on concrete tracks, there’s a section that’s a bit faster along a pavement before the route turns onto a trail at about 3 km in. Now, I remember this bit being sticky before, but today, after the ~550 runners preceding me had skedaddled along it, it was actually just far too slippery for the few of us at the back to run it at all, so cue 1.25 km of me picking my way along the least boggy looking bits of the track, only occasionally breaking into so much as a trot. James comments that even towards the front of the race it was a bit like cross country! So much for my careful run-walk plan.\nFinally, we exited the trail, and we were back on for some more running on tarmac round the offices of the Cambridge Science Park, and yeah for the water station manned by the local scout group, which I needed by then (I took two cups).\nAt 6.5 km in is where you hit the super-fast section, a section very familiar to me as it’s on my (cycling) commute; this is a completely straight flat run (and walk) back towards Histon along the access track of the guided busway, which follows a former railway line.\n[Note, if you\u0026rsquo;re not so used to the busway, which has seen serious accidents on other sections, you do need to take a little care not to stray close to the bus tracks.]\n...even towards the front of the race it was a bit like cross country!  I was starting to feel the distance by now, but more or less was back with running and walking to plan (noting that the extra walking done early in the race didn’t mean I was suddenly able to go at a better pace). When you’re used to going along the route on a bike though, progress while running doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem very speedy in comparison!\nAt this point too, the weather reverted into heavy rain, and I was thinking jealously of James, who was bound to have finished. Finally, a soggy me turned off the busway at 9 km, made it up the brief climb of another muddy path that you had to walk on, and it was just one lap of the recreation ground to go.\nJames was waiting under his umbrella and was trying to encourage me to do more running and less walking, but I was saving myself so as to make sure I actually ran to the finish line. And, success, a sprint finish and I was over it, with the marshals ready to make sure we returned the reusable timing chips. The last thing to do was to collect the fabulous wooden medal, with its bonfire motif (and grab my rain coat).\nWhen you’re used to going along the route on a bike, progress while running doesn't seem very speedy in comparison!  As to times, James did it in 40:19 and me in 1:28:31. I think we both thought these were at least in line with what we might expect, and I was pretty pleased given my most recent benchmark was ~45 min for the First Saturday of the Month 5k (with a whole kilometre of walking, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d never keep it within double that at one point despite the lack of hills).\nObviously, the most important bit of any race is post-run munchies, and since I’d last done the race a new cafe had opened up in what had once been a railway station. Although I’d been there for a lunch, I’d often looked enviously at those enjoying sweet treats and ‘waffles, waffles’ might have been a mantra for whenever I was feeling like I might not make it during the run.\n Waffles, waffles\u0026hellip;\n  The one advantage to being slow is those finishing their own snacks were just starting to vacate the inside tables, so we got to warm up/dry off with hot chocolate and banoffee waffle.

Scouring the internet for traditional \u0026lsquo;Scottish\u0026rsquo; tunes I came across a list of traditional dance tunes that didn\u0026rsquo;t seem dissimilar to those I\u0026rsquo;d been learning already. Obviously the title \u0026lsquo;haste to the wedding\u0026rsquo; jumped out at me and when I saw that it was a jig, I realised that I had better get learning it.\nI have since discovered, courtesy of Wikipedia that \u0026lsquo;haste to the wedding\u0026rsquo; probably dates from the 1700s (which I believe is fairly old as these tunes go) and does have an association with weddings.

Maybe I could play something from that\u0026hellip; Flicking through it, I saw \u0026lsquo;Loch Lomond\u0026rsquo; and thought that might be appropriate. The first verse starts out about the \u0026ldquo;Bonnie banks and bonnie braes, where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond\u0026rdquo;, so far so good, though maybe the sun part was optimistic. Unfortunately, it then takes a turn for the worse with \u0026ldquo;Where me and my true love will never meet again, On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond\u0026rdquo; - maybe not quite right sentiment for a wedding after all.\nWe\u0026rsquo;d overlooked the fact that, as we\u0026rsquo;d learnt at various folk festivals and concerts, a disproportionate amount of folk songs have themes of \u0026lsquo;death and decay\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;love gone wrong\u0026rsquo; or both. According to Wikipedia, even in the apparently more upbeat lyrics \u0026ldquo;O ye\u0026rsquo;ll tak’ the high road, and I\u0026rsquo;ll tak’ the low road, And I\u0026rsquo;ll be in Scotland afore ye\u0026rdquo; the \u0026lsquo;low road\u0026rsquo; actually represents death!\nThe last verse mentioned \u0026ldquo;’Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen, On the steep, steep sides of Ben Lomond\u0026rdquo;. That was ringing in my ears later in the holiday we turned around halfway up Ben Lomond having started our ascent too late in the day (it was more of a mountain and less of a stroll than we had expected).\n As far as we got on \u0026lsquo;The steep, steep sides of Ben Lomond\u0026rsquo;\n  When safely back home, I did go on to learn to play Loch Lomond, and here is a recording with both low and high whistles.\nYour browser does not support the audio element.

I was initially a bit hesitant about this (can we say reluctant\u0026hellip;)","title":"Haste to the wedding: the musical interlude"},{"content":"Where were we; oh yes, we were eloping to Scotland. Wow. It’s still a little scary to think it. And it’s getting even harder to write about. But here’s part two of the ‘haste to the wedding’ story, from leaving home until the end of the wedding day. And for those who don’t know the reason these posts are entitled ‘haste to the wedding’, it will become apparent, but only as you get towards the end of the text. [At an estimated 14-minute read, this post is nearly longer than our ceremony, but I hope you can bear with us. Or skim it. Or just look at the photos.]\n ©Fotomaki. A sneak peek…\n  Anyway, to recap from \u0026lsquo;haste (I)', it’s now the Saturday before the ‘big day’, and we were travelling towards Loch Lomond, Scotland but still weren’t quite sure if the location where we’d been planning to have our ceremony was going to work owing to a 500 ft climb.\nWe were just starting to get anxious that we\u0026rsquo;d set our wedding organiser (Cat of Fin Flükra, a member of the Wee Wild Weddings team) too steep a challenge in the 6 weeks we had given her to arrange our day. We were starting to think too hard… What if somehow neither of the locations we were exploring were practical? How wide was the jurisdiction of the registry office? Could we do any of it at our accommodation? What does airbnb mean by an \u0026lsquo;event\u0026rsquo;? How can one actually access Strathcashell point? Does Loch Lomond have tides? Or monsters?\nDoes Loch Lomond have tides? Or monsters?  And then, to our relief, the confirmation came through - Cat had arranged special permission from the forest ranger to drive at least a little way up the hill on the access track at Cashel Forest. Views over the loch suddenly sounded much more achievable. Mind by that point, we were less confident on having a view because we’d hit the ‘north’ (well, County Durham) and the weather was a bit more than wet; it was us driving through a very low, very soggy, very raining cloud, with visibility about as far as your nose.\nIt’s not that we’d not been fully understanding that holidays in west Scotland in September, or indeed at any time, are likely to involve a fair amount of weather (and we had a hefty bill from Decathlon for outdoor gear as proof). However, the rain finally seen after months of dry conditions at home had mainly come in the form of thunderstorms, and the thought of it being quite so continuously miserable for the next 2 weeks was a bit of a concern. We consoled ourselves by remembering that at least it might keep the midges down.\nThen, almost magically, upon exiting the Pennines and travelling into Cumbria, there was a distinct edge to the line of heavy cloud, and the other side was bright. We descended towards the Lake District in the sun, setting the scene for a lovely two nights spent with relatives near Penrith.\n Driving out of the cloud\n  The only thing making that visit a little tense was the need to keep the elopement side of things a secret, which was especially hard when we didn’t manage to keep the suit holder out of sight. Indeed, why would anyone bring a smart jacket on an ‘outdoor’ holiday!? The best we could do was some quick muttering about needing it for a restaurant. I’m promised after the fact that they didn’t suspect, but it was just as well the dress was safely tucked out of sight in its own special suitcase.\nHowever, it was soon time to set off to reach Scotland, that is after getting one final bit of wedding paperwork completed from a supermarket car park en route - namely, making sure the registrar had the correct location for the schedule. As it turns out, once you’re away from a defined address or named location, it’s a 10-digit grid reference that’s needed. This actually works out as a 1 m square, and the somewhat amusing thought of everybody having to stand very close to each other (in reality, there is some discretion on the day anyway - if it’s truly wet enough to saturate the all important bit of paper, the celebrant is permitted to rush everyone to the nearest dry space to actually sign the thing. Like the back of the car!).\n…it was just as well the dress was safely tucked out of sight in its own special suitcase.  A not too long drive around Glasgow, and we were at the barn we were staying in, just in time to decant all the clothes and other sundries, and nip off round for a late afternoon ‘stroll’ to check out the ceremony location, just in case. And in fact it wasn’t just us checking it out, Sarah (Fotomaki Photography, a member of the Wee Wild Weddings team) had been able to get there by that day too. Although we believed her reassurance of how beautiful it was, and took on board how it might be nice to save seeing the place as a surprise, that just wasn’t us - we had to see for ourselves.\n ©Fotomaki. The way to the viewpoint\n  It is safe to say we weren’t disappointed. The first thing to great you is a pasture field complete with a small herd of belted Galloways! And also, as we’d worked out from the maps, there was the 500 ft climb to the viewpoint… which proved, yes, Scotland has a lot of up. However, several track switchbacks, a slightly boggy path and a meander through some heather and bracken, and we were at the spot we intended to use.\nOh my.\nNot only a view of the loch, but across forest and fields to the mountains beyond. And if that weren’t enough, you were actually stood on top of a smallish heather- and bilberry-covered mound, which did nothing if not add to the fact this would be one hell of an occasion venue, quite literally you would be putting yourself (with the celebrant and witnesses - it was about 10 m across!) on a pedestal. Perhaps a somewhat exposed pedestal though (the weather by now was back to being suitably dramatic, with dark threatening-looking clouds, spots of drizzle, wind scooting around). But yes, this would work; it would beyond work. It was incredible.\n Waves scudding on Loch Lomond two days before the wedding\n  So with a last-minute email to everyone just to note sensible shoes were required, that if the cows were still there, we also needed to get them in a photo, and to suggest a couple of tweaks to the ceremony transcript to reflect the location, all that was left to do before the day was collecting the necessary paperwork from the registrar, which you have to do in person. So next morning, we made the trip over to a village called Balfron.\nShould you ever find yourself there, don’t confuse the registrar building with the next-door public toilets. Both have a rather rustic, dare I say even say ramshackle, appearance complete with much shabby chic wood and flaking paint. Eventually, it became apparent which was the correct building because it was the one with the ‘intention’ notices on the outside - two A4 sheets full of people for marriages, and two couples in total for civil partnerships (I guess it was reassuring we weren’t the only ones).\nShould you ever find yourself there, don’t confuse the registrar building with the next-door public toilets.  That collected, it was necessary to stop by Doyles Cafe, a few doors up, to recuperate. One rather delicious lemon drizzle cake and an iced biscuit so freshly made the owner didn’t have them out to sell as they were still too sticky, and it was time to forget about the impending tomorrow, and actually do some holiday, with our first Scottish walk, Conic hill.\nConic hill is a fairly steep climb, you get to ~360 m (1180 ft) at the top, and is not without quite a few other tourists, but there’s a good reason for that, a proper path and another one of those spectacular views - you’re can see right across a line of the islands of Loch Lomond in one direction and along the ridge of the highland boundary fault in the other. But there’s a even better reason to visit Conic hill. Highland cows. Lots of highland cows. I ❤️ Scotland.\n I\u0026rsquo;m very fluffy\n  The route down back to the loch was more tricky, and definitely had quite a bit of bog, especially at the point we somehow found ourselves following the stream and not the path. Scotland has a right to roam, which on the one hand is freeing, but I’m also not sure if that right doesn’t lead to the odd occasion of paths becoming trails forking in all different directions. It wasn’t ideal me drenching my walking boots with muddy goo when I’d need them for a wedding outfit the next day! Eventually we stumbled out of the woods back to the loch edge not too far from another known beauty spot, the beach at Milarrochy Bay, a super place to chill out in the sun and take in the views. And wash the mud off ones boots in the loch.\n Panorama view of Milarrochy Bay, although the tree in the loch was actually out of the loch\n  That night, the night before the wedding, we also managed to tick off one of those Scotland bucket list things in the pub at Balmaha. Having haggis while in Scotland (we don’t really need an excuse for haggis, but this one seemed legitimate).\nSo, anyway here we are, it was finally the day; the day of the wedding. I can’t even begin to imagine how stressful it would be if you’d had longer to think on it than 8 weeks. Of course, the plan here hadn’t been left to chance. Cat had provided us with a timetable, and we knew where we were supposed be and what we were supposed to be doing when. Mostly.\nFirst things first. Breakfast. Outside on the picnic table. In short sleeves. What was going on; this was the second day in a row that was bright, sunny, still and warm. I have to be honest, I hadn’t really dared look at the weather forecast, what it would be was what it would be [we’ve been asked what would have happened if it had chucked it down, and the answer of course is we’d have had the wedding in the rain]. But never once had I imagined it would actually be… sunny.\nWe don’t really need an excuse for haggis…  Jenna, our make-up artist, was there shortly after breakfast, or during our second cup of coffee anyway, and by that time I was getting nervous. Silly really, but if you’re allowed to be emotional on any day, I think James and I can be forgiven here. Anyway, after suitably admiring what a gorgeous place it was that we were staying in, she proved her skill by somehow keeping me looking like me, only a million times better. To keep James busy, he was given the task of preparing thank you cards for those with us on the day. And having to do his tie up at least twice to get it approximately the length you’re supposed to have it.\nThen Sarah arrived, and with her the suitably breathtaking flowers from the florist Briar Rose Design. The smell from them was divine (honeysuckle I could definitely see, not sure if there were sweet peas in the mix too, but whatever it was, very nice niffs; in hindsight, I probably should have taken the moment to get them in some water for a few minutes but I was too busy admiring them). Also there was the one extra I’d really wanted - a flower crown. This was nothing like the folk festival version though, the real roses and rose hips were a far cry from anything I’d ever worn before.\n ©Fotomaki. Making me look like me, only better\n  So remembering the gifts that we were to exchange at the ceremony, we set off on the few minutes drive to the forest’s car park in convoy to meet our celebrant Kendal (@kendalthecelebrant from the Scottish Humanist Society). As we said hi, I took one look at her and thought ‘arrggg’ as I realised I hadn’t picked up the schedule she\u0026rsquo;d need from where we’d carefully stashed it under a lamp base, and although really I knew James hadn’t either, I couldn’t help but ask in hope. Oops. We had to go back.\nTop tip - write a checklist of stuff to bring with you on the day in advance, you won’t quite be thinking clearly when it comes to it!\nEveryone was so so sweet about the false start [Kendal regaled me with stories of where the schedule had been left at a location somewhat further than a mile away]. It also gave me a chance to say hi to the post-wedding picnic people, who knew precisely where to set up having actually done a picnic there before (although they would not let me see what they doing while it was still a work in progress - I didn’t peek, I swear!).\n ©Fotomaki. Cashel forest visitor centre\n  Thankfully James returned promptly, with documents safely clutched in an envelope, finally ready to be handed over to Kendal. Ok, time to set off driving partway up that hill. The ranger had spotted us, and was even on hand to open the gate onto the track, and wish us luck too. There followed a few moments wishing for a four-by-four, but slow progress in a car was still faster and less effort than walking, and at last we parked up at the borrow pit.\nHowever, of course we weren’t at the mound. I don’t know why - well, I partly do, it was because I was trying to go slow enough not to sweat (it was really too hot even for my special Niamh Designs denim jacket) - but the short walk seemed to go on forever. Maybe it was just because it was a bit weird James and I leading a small entourage up a hill in our wedding clothes (at least my boots had dried).\n ©Fotomaki. Lets walk slowly\n  But we all arrived in reasonable order, and there was time for a moment. It really was a magical view.\nI don’t remember all the details of the ceremony, it’s the proverbial all a bit of a blur. Thankfully, we have a transcript!\nThere was a bit of an introduction from Kendal on who she was, where we were, a bit of a story of our one of our first ‘dates’, which James hadn’t remembered at all until I told Kendal. Then there was a gift exchange, somewhat awkwardly conducted as there’s no spot to put things down out in the wilds, and by that time I had taken my jacket off, so no pockets.\n ©Fotomaki. The ceremony\n  My gift was fairly traditional, a special piece of jewellery from Sarah Brown Jewellery, a Scottish designer based not too far away on the island of Islay, whereas James got his new tin whistle, a brass affair from Killarney whistles. I couldn’t help but encourage him to give it a go, even if it was a bit off script for him to burst out into the opening bars of The Kesh jig quite at that point.\nWhat was on script, however, was for him to play the Scottish jig ‘haste to the wedding’ (well sort of Scottish - in the Scottish tradition anyway) and the Irish polka ‘rattlin’ bog’ as a true musical interlude on the ceremony. [The word bog appears seven times in this post, there is a lot of water up in these parts!] It’s actually impossible to play the tin whistle in any sort of breeze, so we did have a back up plan, and had made a recording of these (with the plan to also use that in the event of James being overcome with emotion). But as it turns out, he aced them on the day (he says not, but I\u0026rsquo;m biased).\n ©Fotomaki. Playing haste to the wedding… you still needed to point downwind\n  So as not to let the recordings go to waste, here’s a wee interlude in the post (the ceremony wasn’t long, even if me writing about it is going on more than I thought it would; I remember Kendal commenting once about making sure we still felt we’d got our ‘money\u0026rsquo;s worth’ if we were only making things quite short!! Not a problem as far as we were concerned):\nRattlin\u0026rsquo; bog Your browser does not support the audio element.  Haste to the wedding Your browser does not support the audio element.  Then, the official bit, the signing of the paperwork, and pass the parcel with fountain pens and clipboard. Kendal ended with a simple blessing.\nTo all the days here and after, may they be filled with fond memories, happiness and laughter.\n And that was it. Well, not it for the day, but it for the forever ever after.\n[Just one more top tip to suggest here, this is the point we could have (should have) whipped out our mobile phone and made sure we’d recorded the scene from our view angle. But thankfully Kendal at some point (probably in the moment we first arrived) had used her mobile phone, which means we do in fact have a snapshot of both Sarah and Jenna, who were doing double duty by acting as our as witnesses. You guys won’t be forgotten by us.]\nThen there was a little time for a few more photos. I don’t think I need explain how skilled Sarah is - I think that’s apparent. Although there was one where we were asked to ‘cuddle’ and move closer, which almost resulted in a photo of the two of us falling over. You guessed it, there was a bog under our feet!\n ©Fotomaki. Cashel Forest at its late-summer best\n   ©Fotomaki. Oops… it\u0026rsquo;s a bit boggy\n  Another careful drive back down the track, a thumbs up to the ranger to indicate it had all happened, no last-second wobbles, and time to chase the belted Galloways. You never know with cows if they’re going to be there or not, and they hadn’t been around when we first arrived in the ‘without the forms’ moment. However, even from the ceremony hill, we’d spotted that they were back, even if no one else had.\nSorry Sarah, we know the adage ‘never work with animals’ but “look at each other” was not going to work at that moment, James and I both know if there are cows, we\u0026rsquo;ll keep getting drawn back to look at the cows.\n ©Fotomaki. There they nibble\n  The last ‘external’ part of the day was really easy - to enjoy the picnic styled by Scottish Wild Picnics with more of the stunning flowers. And Cashel Forest excelled for a location for that too, with a secluded picnic bench tucked away in the shimmering sunlight of a forest glen next to the waterfalls of Cashel Burn. The picnic seemed enough to feed ten, but particular goodies included the venison chorizo from Great Glen Charcuterie and smoked muscles from the Argyll Smokery. And the cheese, and the cream tea in a jar, and the shortbread… (and bits from Tunnocks).\nAll the delicious leftovers were packed and up and delivered to us back at the barn we were staying at, then taken around with us for the rest of the Scottish minimoon.\n ©Fotomaki. Picnic in the glade\n  What’s left to say but thank you very much to everyone from the Wee Wild team, Kendal, Jenna, Cashel Forest Trust and all the other small businesses (links have been given) who helped us pull this off. It was all we could have ever imagined, only it was also sunny.\nWhat’s left to say but thank you very much…  Oh… and to mention, yes, we did indeed ring our immediate family on arrival back at the barn, virtually sharing a glass of Champagne.

And as we’ve been asked a few times what prompted this, a blog post seems in order. However, that’s not really so easy to write, not least because of course this is all quite personal. But, here we are with a little of the story - although I think we can all agree this is mainly about sharing the photographs! Although that will mostly have to wait for blog instalment II.\n ©Fotomaki. A preview photo…\n  First, let’s make one thing absolutely clear - this was a true elopement, and our friends and family did not know we were going to do this in advance. Although we could never have imagined us having a big wedding complete with party - we just don’t know enough people for one thing - even a micro-wedding (generally thought of as \u0026lt;25 guests) just always somehow felt too much, a statement that after 20 years something is different when in fact our aim is for the opposite, for nothing to be different. However, the alternative, or so we thought, of just popping over to the registry office in Stevenage to sign a bit of paper, felt too much the other way - lacking in the romantic.\nThen earlier this year my sister got married at a small venue in Cornwall, a venue we learnt more usually hosted elopements rather than even micro-weddings. Once home, a little bit of internet searching revealed that there is a whole industry that is geared to helping couples arrange elopements - weddings with just the couple themselves, or perhaps them and no more than a handful of guests - which was quite a surprise given we’d only really been previously vaguely aware of them, perhaps in the context of Gretna Green.\nWe then sort of parked the idea over the early summer, that is until we finally got round to thinking we really needed to start arranging our main holiday of the year ourselves. Hence, the notion, not overly seriously, of perhaps, just perhaps, arranging an elopement to coincide with a holiday.\nAs we often go to Jersey, we had a quick look there, but the ferry timetable this year made the holiday aspects particularly awkward, and anyway their government actually requires a year’s notice (a year!) for a wedding. We found some more elopement places in Cornwall, including one aptly in a former cow shed (yes, we have a particular fondness for cows, just one of those things!) and one in a wood shed, but somehow they weren’t quite right (the cow shed was a bit big, the wood shed was alternatively used as a gym, my sister had already done the castle…) and so we then thought more and more about Scotland.\n…the cow shed was a bit big, the wood shed was used as a gym, my sister had already done the castle  Because it turns out Scotland still has different laws regarding weddings to the rest of the UK - namely you can have them anywhere, not just in a licensed venue. [There are plans to reform this for England and Wales too, which we of course wholeheartedly support.] In fact, James has actually always fancied a holiday in Scotland and has said we should go more than once, but I’ve always been unsure on it, mainly because I’m more frightened of the midges (always pronounced ‘midge-ees’ in our family, as it is in most of Scotland), as biting insects always go for me. But I was not adverse to the idea, as I knew it would be a stunning place to visit.\nThis brings us to our first contact with Wee Wild Weddings, a collective of small businesses that have come together to help couples arrange very small outdoor ‘whatever the weather’ weddings in a shortish timeframe. What they organise looked a perfect fit for us - help with location, a few photos, a few flowers, a special picnic, someone to do my hair and make-up, and a humanist celebrant to make it all legal - but not over the top. And their Instagram (@weewildweddings) showed off Scottish outdoor weddings as beyond glorious, even in some fairly, shall we say changeable, weather conditions.\nI will say this was still a very tentative enquiry with some dates that, even to us, were now seemingly scarily close (about eight weeks off) - let’s be honest, we were absolutely sure we couldn’t pull it off without some professional help. I was fully expecting them to say no, it sadly wouldn’t be possible, they were too busy (COVID delays have meant there are a lot of weddings this year), it would be too soon to organise etc., but on the Monday morning there was a reply, saying, yes, it really, really could be done.\nWow… but scary at the same time.\nAt 6 weeks to go, after a video call with Sarah from Fotomaki Photography, a member of the Wee Wild team - who was very reassuring about the midges (well, that is she told us of two non-DEET repellents that actually worked) - we signed the contract to go ahead. And then, a bit of a mad scramble started; forms to allow this to be an official, legally binding civil partnership needed to reach the appropriate registrar with a minimum of 29 days to go.\nyes, it really, really could be done. Wow… but scary at the same time.  It’s not a lie when you’re told Scotland has it all with regard to beyond stunning locations for weddings; you have forest glades, magical waterfalls, soaring mountains, dramatic lochs, sandy beaches, cliff-side beaches, fairy-tale ruined castles… every cliche you can think of cannot possibly describe how beautiful it can be. However, we settled on saying the Loch Lomond area, mainly so as to not go mad with a super long drive from home, and for self-catering style accommodation as opposed to a hotel. With that decided, we set about, with the help of the Wee Wild team, on finding places that worked as both having somewhere lovely to stay with somewhere lovely to have a wedding close by.\nSeveral emails (I make it ten; sorry to Sarah and Cat of Fin Flükra, the organiser member of the Wee Wild team) and much perusing of the internet later, and we had booked a super romantic barn towards the middle of the eastern side of Loch Lomond (that side of the loch is within the Loch Lomond \u0026amp; The Trossachs National Park) and narrowed down the location to two options, Strathcashell point or Cashel Forest. And with the forms finally in to the registrar (with even her reassuringly mentioning, yes, we could change the location slightly right up until the point we actually picked up the schedule - and maybe that we’d even want to after checking the weather forecast), we could relax, well a little.\n Strathcashell point in the early evening\n  Shortly after that, we also virtually met our celebrant, the lovely Kendal (@kendalthecelebrant from the Scottish Humanist Society). I’m not sure if she was just a little bemused by us - as she says, \u0026ldquo;every wedding is different because every couple is different\u0026rdquo;, but there was a bit of would you like to include this, that or the other (e.g. do vows or personal words), and we were err… no thank you, too ‘mushy’.\nWe also settled on no rings but there would be a gift exchange, and that, weather-depending, James, would play a wee tune on the tin whistle (a new hobby taken up during lockdown). OK, I talked him into the whistle-playing part - he’s generally not too sure on public playing yet, but honestly, his ‘toots’ sound good to me and it would just be us, Kendal, Sarah and our make-up artist Jenna (who was not only up for the challenge of doing hair and make-up for someone whose knowledge of such things could fit on a postage stamp, but had wonderfully agreed to accompany us to the ceremony to act as a witness).\nThe other thing to organise on our part while these things were were being sorted was of course some clothes for both James and me. I knew heels would be out even if I were in a building with a nice flat floor, and also knew they’d be no time to get a ‘true’ wedding dress done, even if that was within budget. And I wasn’t even sure on what type of dress to go for - just a ‘nice dress’ or one a bit ‘more obviously’ wedding.\nCue a bit of me prancing around going, it fits, it fits…  But actually quite early on, I made a somewhat speculative sale purchase on what I can only describe as an ultra-feminine Champagne-coloured lace dress from the London-based company Needle and Thread, which has both gowns in larger sizes and ones that are designated ‘ankle’ length - which you can indeed take as just above the floor for wearing flats and not being the height of a model.\nThere was a little issue in trying it on - for reasons unrelated to superstition, I still didn’t want James to actually see me in the dress, but it was too delicate for me to be able to do up the zip myself. Cue a bit of covering myself up with a dressing gown, so at least James only saw the dress’s back, and then me prancing around going, “it fits, it fits” (and it actually did make me feel quite special, even if I didn’t vocalise that).\nNow, although at that point we hadn’t seen any rain in Hertfordshire for months, I wasn’t unmindful that it could be very different in Scotland and that having a cover-up of some sort would be sensible. And that’s when I came across Niamh Designs, a Northern-Ireland-based small business supplying embroidered denim and faux-leather bridal jackets. Once I’d seen the design ‘wise men say…’, I couldn’t quite get it out of my head as perfect for someone who’d been with their other half 20 years already but also a joke on the fact that the wedding certainly hadn’t been long in the planning. And for someone looking to tone down the prettiness of a dress just a tad! I’d like to thank the owner for helping me make sure I could order it in time, given her lead times were really a little longer than we had.\n ©Fotomaki. The wedding jacket\n  With me sorted, that just left James. Of course he has a suit in the back of the cupboard somewhere, and of course it didn’t fit (too big). We then went though a gamut of options, yes, including the obligatory thought that this would be Scotland, you could hire a kilt, before eventually settling on we’d go for chinos, jacket and tie. It seemed that then every Saturday was spent in Hitchin trying to decide on what jacket, what tie.\nThree weeks to go, and finally the jacket was bought - and we were thankful that the friend who had ‘popped round from The Netherlands’ on short notice that very morning and had to wait for our return from the shops didn’t enquire too closely on whose wedding we urgently needed this jacket for.\nIt took until one week to go until we had some boots, a shirt and a tie to complete his outfit, together with the chinos we already owned. Phew.\nWith decisions on picnic options having been given to Scottish Wild Picnics (the buffet option, but more on that next time), colour thoughts provided to the florist Briar Rose Design (cream and pastels to match the dress with clashing orange and hot pink to make them less feminine feeling) - pretty much it had all come together.\nwe were thankful that [they] didn’t enquire too closely on whose wedding we urgently needed this jacket for  Apart from that is we were now the day before leaving for the trip, and the ceremony location still wasn’t fully pinned down. At this point, it felt like it was to be Cashel Forest, but for that option, it needed us to do a 500 ft climb to get to where we wanted to be (that is to a place that had a view of the loch; we just couldn’t go to a place that had such a view and not make it to the viewpoint!).\nAlthough 500 ft up on a semi-easy track isn’t too bad in normal circumstances, it always was a concern for me how that could be very different when wearing a wedding dress, especially when logistics meant we did need to get to the ceremony location without taking so long walking there that we’d go over the amount of time allotted for Sarah to take photographs. [I should say here, it wasn’t entirely unexpected we might still not have the location finalised - right from the start, we knew nobody (except as it turned out the picnic people) had visited either of the two possible locations and that meant some question marks around details and timings (we were now running at over 30 emails with Cat). This is just part of the ‘fun’ when sorting it all quite so close to the date!]\nBut, ceremony location excepting, we were finally there - at the time for… packing.\nWe’re never very good at getting off for places on time, but here there was a bit more stress than you even have when you need to catch a plane or ferry. The checklist for stuff to take eventually reached three A4 pages. Extension leads, a button-down top, midge repellents, tick tweezers, yes, yes and yes. Plus rather a lot more.\nSo shortly after lunch (we\u0026rsquo;d unrealistically been aiming for mid-morning) on one Saturday in September, it was time to be off.\nWe were eloping to Scotland.\n Extra shots  The Scottish midge forecast\nhttps://www.smidgeup.com/midge-forecast/   Credits Pictures from Sarah are marked as copyright of Fotomaki Photography, and are used with permission.

And as we’ve been asked a few times what prompted this, a blog post seems in order. However, that’s not really so easy to write, not least because this is all quite personal. But, here we are with a little of the story…","title":"Haste to the wedding (I): before the trip"},{"content":"I’m writing this on Friday 24th June, what is apparently ‘National Cream Tea Day’, and while the cynic in me suggests that this is just another marketing opportunity, I also seem to have succumbed to scone fever with two recent events requiring the baking of scones in fairly large quantities.\nHowever, it’s not me doing the baking - James is the one who’s rather good at scones - so much so that I call his scones ‘the clouds’. Hence, another recipe-sharing blog post (jump to recipe).\nScone recipes are really really variable, especially regarding how much sugar and butter you use, suggesting a good deal of do as you like, but one thing I definitely recommend is going for a recipe with an egg. It probably tips the mixture a little more towards cakes, but seems to make it so much easier to get a light texture. Our recipe doesn’t have much sugar either, so is a definitely more suited to adding a whole load of jam. And yes, for a special occasion good jam is needed, not glucose/fructose syrup jam.\n Making scones for the FSotM, and leftovers\n  Anyway, back to the events, the first (which you might describe as a practice for the second) being our local First Saturday of the Month 5 km race on 4th June, where the call had gone out to bring cakes, ideally scones, for participants as part of its Queen’s jubilee theme.\nThe only thing was, we weren’t quite sure how many were wanted, so we ended up making 16. However, so did quite a few other people, and after we’d taken them up there (nearly making us late for the race with splitting and adding jam and cream), it was clear there was going to be over-provision - in the end, a good deal of them were eaten, but a good number also came back home with us. Not a hardship you might say; although really scones are a day-of-baking eat, that’s only necessary to experience perfect cloudiness!\nThe second event came with rather more pressure, as I’d long-ago volunteered James to provide scones for my sister’s wedding. And this took place in… Cornwall, home of scones.\n Getting the eye in with a professional cream tea at a cafe near the beach\n  Baking can be challenging enough even in your home oven, but there’s added ‘fun’ in a location ~300 miles away. And, other than moral support, I wasn’t going to be of much use on the day, as getting ready would take up my time (a week’s holiday at the seaside including a trip out on a boat doesn’t do any favours to your hair).\nWe’d of course started with a list of things to pack that might not be required on a usual holiday - ingredients (minus eggs!), scales, rolling pin, baking and cooling trays, cutters. And by making sure that ordering of clotted cream and jam were under control.\nAnd then nothing left to do but a fairly early morning start so the scones would be as fresh as possible. The back-right scone over baked in the oven, we’d not brought an egg wash brush, and were thankful our accommodation had a sieve, which had also been forgotten (in fact, the place we stayed was provisioned with more kitchen equipment than you might expect). We then found we had to borrow a tea towel for the scone serving tray, but as one was a Cornish flag, that seemed appropriately themed. Phew, no disasters. Guests were counting on us.\n Our instructions were to arrive with the scones already loaded with cream and jam, and to do half of the scones jam first (the Cornwall way) and half cream first (the Devon way), which we dutifully followed.\nAt home, we do usually only get as far as whipped cream, but when in Cornwall\u0026hellip; three whole 1 lb tubs of clotted cream had been provided. OK, we actually only used one, but the larger tubs gave a suitable showing off for the layer of butter that forms on the top of clotted cream, which I\u0026rsquo;ve actually only just learnt is so-called because it\u0026rsquo;s made by heating whole milk until ‘clots’ of cream rise to the surface.\n After a quick change for the baker into wedding clothes, the only remaining difficulty was to get the now 50 half scones safely to the venue during typical English summer weather (wind, rain and sun) and without potholes causing bouncing for the tray. Hurrah for no actual rain during the decanting of the scones from kitchen to car and back from car to the venue\u0026rsquo;s kitchen!\nIn celebration of this achievement, the only appropriate thing to do was to make sure the baker also acted as server.\nI can say that the Cornish jam-then-cream way seemed the most popular, but that might have been because the photographer, the only native Cornwall-resident to try one, loudly proclaimed that as a must shortly after we brought them out.\n They all vanished quite quickly! Yummy.\nScone recipe Makes about eight.\nIngredients  225 g plain flour 1 good teaspoon baking powder 85 g cold butter, cubed 15 g caster sugar 1 egg, beaten 35 ml milk pinch of salt (if not using salted butter), egg or milk for glazing, flour for dusting  Method  Preheat over to 200 °C (fan). Sift the flour and sugar (and a pinch of salt if using unsalted butter) into a bowl, and rub in the cold butter until mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add egg and milk into mixture. Mix ingredients well to form soft dough, but be careful not to overwork. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to ~2 cm thick. Cut out scones using an ~5 cm cutter (aside: ours came in 4.8 cm and 5.8 cm, so dainty wedding scones and bigger running scones). Avoiding twisting the cutter to help rise. Put cut out scones on a baking tray. Glaze tops with milk or egg (not letting it dribble down the side, also to help rise). Bake in the pre-heated oven for 8-10 min until looking slightly golden. Leave to cool on a wire rack, then serve split with jam and (clotted) cream.

Until today, these had been placed using a font kit from Font Awesome, which worked by using JavaScript to replace tags in the form of \u0026lt;i class=\u0026quot;fa-…\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; with the appropriate icon from their library.\nHowever, for some time I’d been wanting to move away from this method because hosting stuff away from your site is a privacy concern; at the very least, the IP address of the visitor will be passed onto a third party, but in the case of Font Awesome’s kits, they also collect information like how many times kits have been used etc.. Also, I just wanted more flexibility than you get limiting yourself to one source of icons.\n The obvious choice to replace an icon font is to move to using svg icons, especially when you don\u0026rsquo;t have too many icons in the site, as is the case here. However, doing this hasn\u0026rsquo;t been quite as straightforward as I expected. Below records some whys and wherefores of the process.\nHow to place svg icons The simplest, and perhaps the most flexible, method to add an svg icon to html is simply place your svg code inline, i.e. directly into the html inside \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; … \u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; tags.\nThis method allows full css access to the paths within the svg itself, and hence you can do all sorts of fancy things, such as animate your icons, really quite easily.\nHowever, there\u0026rsquo;s an issue just doing this too - precisely that your svg code appears in your html code. If you are ever viewing the actual html source, then it\u0026rsquo;s cluttered with an awful lot of content from svgs.\nHence, James and I are using two other methods for icon svgs:\n \u0026lsquo;Cloning\u0026rsquo; from an external svg sprite file Assigning with css on pseudo-elements  Svgs from an external svg sprite file This method involves placing all your svg icons in a single text file and calling the the specific one you want via its id #identifier with the \u0026lt;use\u0026gt; attribute.\nThus, you have an external file \u0026lsquo;icon.svg\u0026rsquo; of the form:\n\u0026lt;svg xmlns=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- svgs from Feather Icons (https://feathericons.com; MIT License) --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;symbol id=\u0026#34;arrow-right\u0026#34; role=\u0026#34;img\u0026#34; viewBox=\u0026#34;0 0 24 24\u0026#34; fill=\u0026#34;none\u0026#34; stroke=\u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34; stroke-width=\u0026#34;2.5\u0026#34; stroke-linecap=\u0026#34;round\u0026#34; stroke-linejoin=\u0026#34;round\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;feather feather-arrow-right\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;line x1=\u0026#34;5\u0026#34; y1=\u0026#34;12\u0026#34; x2=\u0026#34;19\u0026#34; y2=\u0026#34;12\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/line\u0026gt;\u0026lt;polyline points=\u0026#34;12 5 19 12 12 19\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/polyline\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/symbol\u0026gt; \u0026lt;symbol id=\u0026#34;arrow-left\u0026#34; role=\u0026#34;img\u0026#34; viewBox=\u0026#34;0 0 24 24\u0026#34; fill=\u0026#34;none\u0026#34; stroke=\u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34; stroke-width=\u0026#34;2.5\u0026#34; stroke-linecap=\u0026#34;round\u0026#34; stroke-linejoin=\u0026#34;round\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;feather feather-arrow-left\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;line x1=\u0026#34;19\u0026#34; y1=\u0026#34;12\u0026#34; x2=\u0026#34;5\u0026#34; y2=\u0026#34;12\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/line\u0026gt;\u0026lt;polyline points=\u0026#34;12 19 5 12 12 5\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/polyline\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/symbol\u0026gt; \u0026lt;symbol id=\u0026#34;layers\u0026#34; role=\u0026#34;img\u0026#34; viewBox=\u0026#34;0 0 24 24\u0026#34; fill=\u0026#34;none\u0026#34; stroke=\u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34; stroke-width=\u0026#34;2.5\u0026#34; stroke-linecap=\u0026#34;round\u0026#34; stroke-linejoin=\u0026#34;round\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;feather feather-layers\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;polygon points=\u0026#34;12 2 2 7 12 12 22 7 12 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/polygon\u0026gt;\u0026lt;polyline points=\u0026#34;2 17 12 22 22 17\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/polyline\u0026gt;\u0026lt;polyline points=\u0026#34;2 12 12 17 22 12\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/polyline\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/symbol\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; and then in the html, for e.g. a right arrow:\n\u0026lt;svg class=\u0026#34;my-icon-class\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;use href=\u0026#34;/path/to/icon.svg#arrow-right\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; You are very limited on what can be styled via the css my-icon-class (this is because cloning results in a non-exposed DOM tree), but that\u0026rsquo;s fine for many simple icons.\nSvgs with css on pseudo-elements We also use svg icons on pseudo-elements, which are inserted via the css. In particular, the triangular caret bullet for unordered lists in posts is inserted as a background-image on its ::before pseudo-element, and moved around to where it looks nice by playing with the margins (I have no issues using negative margins for positioning).\nul li::before { content: \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; background-image: url(\u0026#39;caret-right-solid.svg\u0026#39;); background-repeat: no-repeat; height: 1.1em; width: 1.1em; position: absolute; margin: 0.35em 0 0 -1.6em; } This method doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow you to change your svg at all with css (e.g. for colour), so you\u0026rsquo;re limited to doing that within the svg itself.\nThere is also a ::marker pseudo-element, which specifically selects the marker of a list item, and hence could be useful for styling lists with custom bullets. However, at present \u0026lsquo;content\u0026rsquo; for that element is not a supported option in Safari (see caniuse), although that might not be too long away as support has appeared in the \u0026lsquo;technology preview\u0026rsquo; version.\n Ensuring accessibility One of the advantages claimed of svgs vs icon fonts is that accessibility can be built into svgs themselves, as svgs can have child elements, especially \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;, which can be used to pass information to assistive technology, especially screen readers.\nHowever, many, if not most, uses of icons are in fact just decorative, and for those there is no issue as they just should be hidden from screen readers with aria-hidden=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;. Background images, by definition, will also be hidden, and are always decorative in this blog.\nPertinently, however, we are also using icons in the prose of the posts, as you would emojis, and those do have semantic meaning that can change depending on context. Or, for instance, it\u0026rsquo;s actually an array of five separate icons that makes an image with four filled stars and then one empty star  - and collectively that\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026lsquo;filled star\u0026rsquo; times four followed by \u0026lsquo;empty star\u0026rsquo;, but \u0026lsquo;four out of five stars\u0026rsquo;, yet maybe in another case the icon star  should indeed be read as \u0026lsquo;filled star\u0026rsquo; or just \u0026lsquo;star\u0026rsquo;. In yet other cases, the star could only be decorative. Thus, you need to provide a descriptive text that is modifiable for each use.\nHence, to completely hide decorative icons, yet implement a description easily within the content written in markdown and processed into html by Hugo (i.e. in the posts themselves; see setting up the blog), we decided to keep it simple, and add aria-hidden=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; to all icons and to build in screen reader text into the shortcode that calls icons for when that is necessary. This, however, does mean screen readers don\u0026rsquo;t have the context of whether something is an image or text, so is perhaps something to re-adjust at some point.\nAt the moment, the final Hugo shortcode for our blog post content icons is:\n{{- $icon := .Get 0 -}} {{- $screenreader_text := .Get 1 -}} \u0026lt;svg aria-hidden=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;content-icon\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;use href=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#34;icons.svg\u0026#34; |absURL}}#{{ $icon }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/use\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; {{- with $screenreader_text -}} \u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;sr-only\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ . }} \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{- end -}} This is called with {{\u0026lt; svg_icon identifier \u0026quot;screen reader text\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} in the markdown.\nUnexpected problems and our solutions Sizing When using icons next to prose, emoji style, svg icons turned out to be far more complicated to place than an icon from a font. The only way to do this is was once again by trial and error fiddling with the size and vertical-align until it looked right.\nFor icons in prose here, I went with css to make them a little bigger than the font size and pull them down by 0.25em, and even now I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say this is completely successful as some icons really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a square aspect ratio, a definite disadvantage over a font. Your mileage might vary.\n.content-icon { display: inline-block; width: 1.15em; height: 1.15em; vertical-align: -0.25em; } Using with punctuation So, here I am with sized svg icons in my prose. But ahhhh\u0026hellip; the icons are no longer treated as text as they were when they were a font, and that means they don\u0026rsquo;t stick normally with punctuation.\nIf one of your visitors has just the wrong browser window size, then you get some very odd looking errors as lines start or end with punctuation.\nA bit more hunting around for the html equivalent of the print typesetting instruction \u0026lsquo;do not split\u0026rsquo;, and I discovered what can work here is surrounding your bits of text with a span styled as display: inline-block, as browsers tend to keep these elements together.\nI\u0026rsquo;m rather glad it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen too often, as I\u0026rsquo;m adding this into the markdown these posts are written in by hand - the html isn\u0026rsquo;t really any longer than a Hugo shortcode - but it might be something to look at using javascript for.\nSvg icons and overflow-x Finally, a rather specific issue.\nIn a previous blog post, we have a table where there\u0026rsquo;s a line of stars as a rating of some cross-country races. This table does not fully fit on mobile, and to account for that we\u0026rsquo;d added a wrapper div around the table with overflow-x: auto; css to make sure a horizontal scroll bar appeared when the table was too wide for the viewport.\nWell, that certainly needed some playing with to get to work.\nFirst, within the table cell itself, we needed an extra css wrapper div with the style width: max-content; around the array of separate icons to prevent them cascading vertically, shrinking or overlapping when the table cells weren\u0026rsquo;t wide enough to fit them. Then, all looked well\u0026hellip; until I checked it on the mobile version.\nAhhhhh\u0026hellip; an unwanted horizontal scroll on the entire page and not just the table inside the wrapper. It took forever, but eventually I stumbled on one line of css to add to the overall wrapper div to fix that: position: relative;.\nI can only hope nothing too odd is happening in a (modern) browser I don\u0026rsquo;t test in person; I honestly doubt I\u0026rsquo;d have spotted the issue in an emulator. Although I have seen unwanted horizontal scrolls on plenty of websites that do have the benefit of a professional front-end developer, so maybe this is just tricky.\nIn conclusion… Using svg icons, especially within prose, is more complicated than using an icon font kit, and requires some work.\nBut doing so means I\u0026rsquo;m not having to self-host a large font with lots of icons I\u0026rsquo;d never use or rely on a external icon source, and hopefully having sorted these first few pitfalls, it will get simpler here on in.\n Extra shots  Iconduck resource for freely licensed svg icons\nhttps://iconduck.com Font Awesome on font icons vs svg icons (note, they provide both) (2021)\nhttps://blog.fontawesome.com/webfont-vs-svg/ Michael Irigoyen on on icon fonts vs svg icons (2021)\nhttps://www.irigoyen.dev/blog/2021/02/17/stop-using-icon-fonts/ Chen Hui Jing on the methods for inserting svg icons (2021) https://chenhuijing.com/blog/the-many-methods-for-using-svg-icons/ More on accessible svg icons (2021)\nhttps://css-tricks.com/accessible-svg-icons/ More on accessibility for svgs in general (2021)\nhttps://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/accessible-svg-patterns-comparison/ Elliot Dahl on aligning svg icons with text (2017)\nhttps://blog.prototypr.io/align-svg-icons-to-text-and-say-goodbye-to-font-icons-d44b3d7b26b4 A fancier way to do star ratings with svgs and css (2021)\nhttps://samuelkraft.com/blog/fractional-svg-stars-css   Credits Thank you to those providing the open source icons used here.

In anticipation of muddy and/or cold races, which are the essence of cross country, I also started finding all the kit I would want.\n I\u0026rsquo;ve always found that I\u0026rsquo;m warmer than I\u0026rsquo;d expect during the races themselves (which are generally less than 10 km, so relatively short and fast). Unless it\u0026rsquo;s exceptionally cold, vest and shorts tends to be enough. On the other hand, for warmup and after the race, some warm layers, tracksuit bottoms, puffy jacket, hat and a change of socks are all good. For footwear, either cross-country spikes or trail shoes are all but essential for the muddier courses, which would be very slippery in regular running shoes.\nRace 1: Cheshunt Race 1 took us down towards London for a race around Cheshunt park, a park and local nature reserve near Broxbourne.\n There was a bit of a panic getting to this one, as, unfortunately, that particular morning there was a four-way set of traffic lights at roadworks very near the entrance to the park, causing a bit of a tailback. So, if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t left lots of extra time, or even as much as you meant to (maybe one of us absolutely had to grab a coffee; I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;ve seen the meme), there were some rather unsure moments thinking you weren\u0026rsquo;t going to arrive before the race started as you spotted other participants park up en route and head off hurriedly on foot about a mile from the start.\nThankfully, the organisers gave us an extra 10 minutes to get ready - we weren\u0026rsquo;t the only ones caught out - so with warm-up possible, and taking advantage of more-organised club members who\u0026rsquo;d set up a gazebo, we were ready.\nThe three-lap course took in some of the woods and fields of the park, which apparently was once the grounds of Cheshunt Great House. The scenery included a field of longhorn cows overlooking the race while they took part in some \u0026lsquo;heritage grazing\u0026rsquo; to maintain the grassland.\nThe weather was grey but not raining, and following overnight rain there was good level mud for this first race of the season.\nHaving not taken part in a cross country race since early in 2020 (and generally having done far less racing due to the pandemic), I was a bit unsure what to expect and ended up keeping a little too much in reserve as I was worried about running out of steam halfway round and struggling. I managed to pick up the effort (possibly not the pace!) towards the end of the race, passing more people than passed me.\nRace 2: Trent Park After heavy rain the night before the race, Sunday 12th saw us in for a muddy one in Trent Country Park for the second race, with the day itself warm and still for time of year.\n The two-lap course here takes quite a hilly route, with varied terrain through grass fields and woods, with the organisers having done a great job with marking flags. Mind, when Clare put herself on a bench suitably away from the run route, it didn\u0026rsquo;t quite work out that way, as everyone streamed either side of the bench. She says how you don\u0026rsquo;t quite realise how fast people are going until they appear to be heading directly at you.\nIt was clear that the final few hundred metres was going to be up a particularly steep and churned up hill, so something to bear in mind was to save some energy for a sprint finish.\nFeeling a bit more confident with the first race under my belt and also having recently raced on the road at the Hatfield 5 Mile, I set off a little less conservatively in this one. The course was definitely tough and included some some slippery downhill sections, which didn\u0026rsquo;t offer much chance to recover. Still, I felt I paced it ok and had just enough left for that final muddy hill and the sprint finish.\nRace 3: Stevenage Race three took us to Fairlands Valley Park in Stevenage. Locals might know Fairlands Valley as the location of the Stevenage parkrun, or as our usual mid-week league race location, which are run around the mostly tarmac paths of the northern area of the park. However, the park continues to the south of Six Hills Way with a large grassy area that provided the course for the cross country.\n This course was generally a bit flatter than the preceding two races, but included a few short but steep inclines, some sharp turns and an up-and-over bank obstacle to keep it interesting.\nThe morning of the race was quite foggy, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t the easiest for photos, but Clare did her best, this time from behind a low hedge with a view of the obstacle, so no possibility of being accidentally near to lots of participants.\nStanding at the side of the group at the start, I was slightly taken aback when I heard the starting horn and everyone start to run. It seemed I overcompensated for that moment of surprise by charging to the first corner. In hindsight, and looking back on the results, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that did me any harm though it did mean that I was more trying to keep up rather than overtaking people for the rest of race!\nWith the relatively flat laps, pacing was a little easier to judge than the other courses, and I did my best to use any spare energy I could on the last lap; then it was just a quick trip home to replace it all in the form of xmas treats.\nRace 4: Cassiobury Park  Our first post-Christmas race saw us down at Cassiobury Park, in Watford, for what is the longest run of the series.\nUnlike the other races, I had done a cross country here before because it\u0026rsquo;s the been the location of the Herts County Cross Country Championships. The course (which was slightly different to the County event) began in the grassy area of the park, and having managed to avoid an excited golden retriever who thought they\u0026rsquo;d take part near the start, I set off downhill before crossing the bridges over the River Gade and Grand Union Canal.\nAfter following a track across a golf course there was then a wooded area, where there were two laps of an undulating (running code for hilly) loop, before you retraced the steps back to a finish near the start. The hill up from the bridges to the finish area seemed much longer, hillier and muddier on the way back up!\nOverall, the course was scenic and included a good level of mud and hills. I felt obliged to dock some points when considering the mud rating (see below) as some of the paths were rather stony and there was a little more tarmac than was ideal for wearing spikes.\n Meanwhile, Clare was impressed with the level of civilisation - the park\u0026rsquo;s cafe, still in the location of the 1925 tea room, and set up for outside service, was situated right at the start. With the course being a lollipop with the wood laps around the \u0026lsquo;sweet\u0026rsquo; at some distance, we decided it was best to keep to taking photos on the start and finish \u0026lsquo;stick\u0026rsquo;, giving her time for hot chocolate and marshmallows, while us runners were out of sight.\nRace 5: Royston Heath The final race of the series took us to Therfield Heath on the outskirts of Royston. This area of chalky grassland gave a distinct character to the course, with a slightly springy turf underfoot much of the time. It also featured some very steep inclines. My GPS watch suggests that the total ascent was ~177 m, which was much more than for the preceding events. [I had to recalibrate my \u0026lsquo;hill rating\u0026rsquo; stars.]\n The course comprised one small lap round a relatively open area (presumably to let the field thin out a bit before heading onto narrower paths) followed by two much longer laps. Each of these two big laps had three sectors, which each broadly started uphill before returning down to the centre near the start and finish. There were also a few surprising bonus short but steep up and downs over some ridges and valleys near the end of the lap. At least after the first of the long laps you had a good idea what was coming on the second time round!\n The finish was downhill back towards the same general area as the start and you could see the finish flags from quite some way away and know exactly how far there was to go. Or so I thought\u0026hellip; with what I believed was ~300 m to go I was shocked to see someone overtake me and then not quite head the way I thought we were going.\nI then saw the actual finish less than 100 m away. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this mix up really cost me much time - spurred on by seeing the actual finish, I was able to regain the place in a sprint. Also definitely can\u0026rsquo;t blame the organisers for me missing the two 10 foot high flags with \u0026lsquo;finish\u0026rsquo; written on them and instead fixating on the similar \u0026lsquo;start\u0026rsquo; flags! Think it must have been running-induced brain fog.\nThe heath also has a cafe, but this time Clare forewent this to walk out on the course to take some photos. This course was particularly good for spectators (if you didn\u0026rsquo;t mind the freezing howling wind and the odd bit of hill-related cursing from the runners - Clare) as the laps repeatedly bring the runners back down to the start/finish area, and no point of the course is really very far away. I definitely appreciated the support from the marshalls and the small crowd of spectators.\nMud and hills ratings \u0026hellip;(and my results; scroll on mobile).\n   Race Time Distance (km) Position Mud rating Hills rating     Cheshunt 00:33:35 7.75 93  3 stars out of 5   3.5 stars out of 5    Trent Park 00:32:32 7.32 80  5 stars out of 5   5 stars out of 5    Stevenage 00:32:26 7.87 69  2.5 stars out of 5   1.5 stars out of 5    Cassiobury Park 00:42:38 9.50 75  2.5 stars out of 5   4 stars out of 5    Royston Heath 00:42:32 8.89 72  1 stars out of 5   6 stars out of 6      So, top trumps this year go to Trent Park for mud and Royston Heath for hills, although all races have been brilliant with their various different challenges. Overall, this was a wonderful race series.

I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to write more about that process in a future post, but here I\u0026rsquo;m focusing on my most recent efforts practicing some jigs during January. Hence, \u0026lsquo;jiganuary\u0026rsquo;.\n My high D and low D tin whistles (actually made from plastic)\n  Partly this post has been spurred by my acquisition of some basic recording equipment (microphone and audio interface), so I now have the capability to put my efforts on the web, as you can find below.\nWhat is a jig? [First, let me prefix this with a disclaimer that while I feel my knowledge in these matters has progressed in the past year, I\u0026rsquo;m very far from an expert, so take whatever I say with a pinch of salt. (My answer a year ago would have been \u0026ldquo;not sure but think I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of those? Something to do with folk music?”)]\nThe tin whistle is closely associated with Celtic music, and I mostly play what can be referred to as Irish traditional music. The two most popular types of dance tune in that tradition are jigs and reels.\n...my take is playing the notes at the right time is more important than playing the right notes!  Jigs typically have a 6/8 time signature, which in practice means two groups of three 1/8 notes per bar (in contrast, reels have a 4/4 time signature so notes are grouped in 4s). I think of these groupings as \u0026lsquo;3-ers\u0026rsquo; of notes, but that\u0026rsquo;s only my terminology!\nBeing a form of dance music (but different to \u0026lsquo;dance music\u0026rsquo; as one growing up in the 1990s might think of it), the sense of rhythm is a key aspect. At least that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve read - I\u0026rsquo;m still trying to get fully to grips with it. Basically, my take is playing the notes at the right time is more important than playing the right notes!\nIdeally, we\u0026rsquo;re aiming for a consistent tempo through the piece. The beat can be emphasised by putting a little extra length/volume, typically to the first note in each 3-er (although apparently it can also make sense to instead emphasize the last note in places).\nFocus for jiganuary Other than increasing my rather small repertoire, what was I looking to improve during jiganuary?\nSpeed The tempo at which I can play the jigs is rather slower than they\u0026rsquo;d usually be played. In terms of beats per minute, I\u0026rsquo;m playing at ~70-75 bpm (the convention is that each 3-er counts as a beat, so two beats per bar and 64 beats in total in each of the jigs below). I understand that these would more typically be played by experienced musicians at something more like 110-120 bpm (and that seems to tally with recordings I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to from Spotify etc.).\nIn general, the advice is to only try to up the tempo once you\u0026rsquo;ve mastered other aspects at a slower pace (which I definitely haven\u0026rsquo;t). I\u0026rsquo;d definitely like to get these tunes going a little faster, but feel that will take time and patience!\nOrnamentation Another area I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to be conservative with is resisting the temptation to rush to ornament these tunes. Commonly, these tunes would be played with the addition of cuts, taps, slides and other ornaments in different places to add variety (and an extra level of difficulty).\nI have played a few rolls on the long notes in The Kesh and Willie Coleman\u0026rsquo;s, but other than that have kept them quite plain.\nBreathing One particular area that I have been trying to work on during jiganuary is breathing.\nA feature of this style of music is that there aren\u0026rsquo;t really clearly defined places for wind instrument players to pause for breath. Instead, the practice is to either cut long notes short or drop out a note (typically the middle of a 3er in a jig) in order to breath. In fact, variations in these breathing points are a feature that can add interest to the music.\nUp until recently, I\u0026rsquo;d been more or less not worrying about that and just breathing at the end of phrases - if I didn\u0026rsquo;t run out of breath completely. That approach was ok to a point, but would add pauses and make it difficult to ever play in time with anything else. For the moment, my breathing points are more or less pre-planned rather than spontaneous, but I feel it\u0026rsquo;s a step in the right direction.\nThe tunes and my recordings The Kesh This is a well-known tune with a distinctive opening. We noticed that for a period last summer it was on heavy repeat in our living room as the background music for a commercial (think it must have been by Tourism Ireland) extolling the virtues of holidays in Ireland. As well as shots of the beautiful scenery, there were various clips of the music being played. This means in our household The Kesh is now known as \u0026lsquo;the Irish advert tune\u0026rsquo;.\n...in our household The Kesh is now known as ‘the Irish advert tune’  I learnt this one relatively early in my musical career and, to simplify matters, I think I had replaced the only c sharp in the setting I\u0026rsquo;d printed with a b.\nNow, that I\u0026rsquo;m a bit more practiced and can play c sharp (the note that sounds with all fingers off) without fear of dropping the instrument, I maybe should reconsider that pragmatic choice. The version below is what I\u0026rsquo;m currently playing.\n Your browser does not support the audio element.  The Lilting Banshee Not to be confused with The Banshee (which is a reel that I\u0026rsquo;ve also been learning).\nThis one is relatively new to me (think I first looked at in in December). For whatever reason, possibly the relatively large number of repeated notes, I found this fairly quick to pick up to my imperfect standard.\n Your browser does not support the audio element.  Morrison\u0026rsquo;s The date on my print out of this tune suggests I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it since late October 21.\nI find this one has a bit more variation than some jigs, with a distinct difference between the first and second parts, and unusually the second part isn\u0026rsquo;t a simple repetition. Maybe because of that, I haven\u0026rsquo;t found it the easiest to learn, but feel it\u0026rsquo;s definitely worth the effort.\n Your browser does not support the audio element.  Willie Coleman\u0026rsquo;s I began adding this one to my repertoire during jiganuary itself and am quite pleased with how it\u0026rsquo;s coming along. It has a nice rolling feel to it (at least when played well).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that in the first part the phrasing has some similarities to the jig Out On The Ocean, which was one of the first tunes I learnt, and I sometimes find myself unintentionally detouring into that instead.\nIn case you\u0026rsquo;re wondering why Out On The Ocean doesn\u0026rsquo;t feature in jiganuary, that is because I\u0026rsquo;ve realised there are some serious idiosyncrasies to my playing of that tune, and I am currently trying to unlearn and relearn it!\n Although the high Gs that start the phrases are shown above as long rolls (~g3 in the ABC notation), I\u0026rsquo;ve seen versions where these are replaced with various other sequences that fit the space (such as g2g, gfg or just g3 with or without a pause for breath in the middle or at the end). Seems you can kind of do what you feel there.\nYour browser does not support the audio element.  A note on ABC notation When coming to write this post, I discovered ABC notation, a text file format that I was kind of aware is widely used for representing traditional/folk tunes, but that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t looked too closely at.\nThere are good reasons for the popularity of the notation - it\u0026rsquo;s a very compact and portable format and probably easier to edit than using any wysiwyg score editor.\nThe sheet music shown above was generated from ABC using abcm2ps. In future, I might look more closely at other projects, such as abcjs, that support client side conversion of ABC into sheet music with javascript, and also allow the music to be synthesised and played in the browser.\nThe following files have the ABC notation for the tunes shown above:\n the_kesh.abc lilting_banshee.abc morrisons.abc willie_colemans.abc  Those settings are similar to (or in some cases the same as) settings found on The Session, a website dedicated to Irish traditional music.\n What next? Well, rereading the \u0026lsquo;Focus for jiganuary\u0026rsquo; section above, I see there\u0026rsquo;s still plenty to improve, but also feel it sounds a little joyless, which isn\u0026rsquo;t how I feel about this hobby! Probably I\u0026rsquo;ll keep going with the jigs, but also try something different. Maybe a hornpipe.\n Extra shots  The Celtic Women ensemble playing The Kesh and Morrison\u0026rsquo;s during their tour https://youtu.be/NBK-xqC9u8E Brother Steve\u0026rsquo;s Tin Whistle pages has some detailed thoughts on various aspects of whistle playing http://www.rogermillington.com/siamsa/brosteve/ The Tradschool website has a selection of recordings of whistle/flute music as well as a shop selling related books https://www.tradschool.com/en/tunes  ","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2022/02/jiganuary/","summary":"For the past year, I\u0026rsquo;ve been learning to play the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle\"\u003etin whistle\u003c/a\u003e from a starting point of very little musical experience.

A staple of the takeaway kebab is also a pickled chilli; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dream of picking it out to throw away.\n Chillis are easy to grow, they just need a sunny spot, and ours are actually all grown in plant pots against a south-facing wall. The trouble is you do tend to get a glut and, to make the most of the crop, you need to do some preserving. We often grow a variety suitable for drying (e.g. cayenne long joe or Pinocchio\u0026rsquo;s nose), but this year we\u0026rsquo;ve grown a fleshy variety called Hungarian hot wax, with the intention of pickling for a hit of kebab-style goodness.\nThese are pickled when yellow, rather than when they\u0026rsquo;ve fully ripened and got super hot. Ok, we don\u0026rsquo;t quite do a peck of them, think the volume of a shopping bag, but a few jars is easy.\n All pickle recipes are basically similar; there\u0026rsquo;s vinegar, salt, sugar, spices and water. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ve adapted a recipe from Bread\u0026amp;salt, for a Turkish vibe, but pickled chillis are common in Asian cuisine too.\nPickle recipe Ingredients  250 g Hungarian hot wax chillis (or two small plants worth) ~6 whole peeled garlic cloves 6 bay leaves a handful of dried chickpeas (I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen this in most pickle recipes, but this particular blog said they help keep the pickle juice clear, so we chucked them in) 1 tablespoon table salt 1 teaspoon sugar 250 ml white wine vinegar 250 ml water juice of 1 lemon and half lemon sliced  Method  Prepare some sterilised jars (we just stick them in the oven for a hour on a low heat in a tray with some water). Wash the chillis and cut the stems off. Put the salt, vinegar, water, sugar in a large pan and bring to the boil, then remove from the heat, and add the lemon juice to make the pickle juice. Take the jars and add chickpeas, and a couple of bay leaves and garlic cloves to each jar, then add the chillis. Pour your pickle juice over the chillis, making sure they are covered. Add lemon slices to the top and seal jars. Leave to pickle for about a month in a cool dark place, checking that they remain covered in liquid every now and again.   So, in fact it\u0026rsquo;s three weeks later (no waiting for a month to taste!), and I can confirm they\u0026rsquo;re great. I\u0026rsquo;m sure if you sliced the chillis, they\u0026rsquo;d be ready really quite quickly, some say next day.\n Our chillis were rather variable in heat before pickling (some were \u0026lsquo;tested\u0026rsquo; by stuffing with mozzarella and barbecuing), and although pickling usually diminishes heat levels, here it seems to have evened it out. They\u0026rsquo;ve also kept their yellow-green colour. They won\u0026rsquo;t keep as long as a chutney, but we should get a few more months from our jars.\n Eat with kebab, or as part of a meze.

A few years ago, I discovered decorative planning, and this led me into into exploring the concept of making my own personalised planner (for me, that\u0026rsquo;s designing and printing my basic planner inserts, and then adding lots of stickers, washi tape and doodles, although others do full-on art in their planners).\nAnalog (\u0026lsquo;paper\u0026rsquo;) planning is now partly a hobby and partly just a useful thing to help with general organisation, and, as 2022 approaches, I need to finalise the design and then print my inserts for the coming year.\n Back in 2019, when I decided to make my own planner, the first thing I needed to decide on was how to bind pages together.\nUsing a ring binder (usually six holes for A5 planners) was one option, but opening and shutting the rings to access pages always seemed to be a faff, and I discovered how I much prefer disc binding, which works via punching mushroom-shaped holes in your page and clipping them onto discs. Discs, somehow, seem to get in the way less than rings, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to just take a single page off the discs without all the pages escaping and cascading into your lap.\n Planner stack, with two Happy Planners and my A5 discbound planner\n  There is a large US planner brand that does ready-printed discbound planners, The Happy Planner, but they come in ‘mini’ and ‘classic’ sizes, seven and nine discs, respectively, when I prefer A5, which is eight discs; not that I’m not often tempted by buying a happy planner if I see one that\u0026rsquo;s particularly appealing!\nMy next step was to choose software to make the design. What you need here is software that will allow you to position elements onto a page in the locations you want and save that as a vector format, not as an rasterised image.\nFor a printed planner, you need to be able to set actual physical sizes. Of course, it’s easy enough to use a word-processing or a spreadsheet program for such a design, or you can make them in true publishing software. However, these programs can be pricy and hence I use the vector graphics program Inkscape, which is open source, although not without some frustration to learn to use, as well as you occasionally hitting the odd bug or two. Inkscape\u0026rsquo;s default file format is SVG.\nHaving decided on the style of the planner and the software, I now follow the process below to design and print my planner.\n1. Set up blank pages The purpose of having a blank starting page is to define the area you can add your custom design into.\nAs I discovered planning through Bullet Journalling (a method designed as a simple way to use a notebook as a personal planner; see https://bulletjournal.com), and those who use this system often use notebooks with 5 mm dot grid pages, rather than lined pages, I decided I\u0026rsquo;d also use a 5 mm dot grid as the main guide for \u0026lsquo;freeform\u0026rsquo; areas. I find dot grids are great for giving some structure to pages but without being as obtrusive as lines.\nTo enable easy printing without worrying about margins, my Inkscape template area is a precise A4 (the standard paper size in the UK). Onto this, I set up a 2.5 mm grid in the software; I find doing this gives me the option to add 5 mm dot grids accurately but with a little flexibility when you want something to not quite be 5 mm apart.\nTo make my 5 mm dot grids for the blank planner sections easily, I use a plug-in extension, which James wrote for me.\nInkscape dot grid extension Inkscape extensions provide a mechanism to add custom functionality to Inkscape. The dot grid extension is very simple; in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to think of a simpler extension. As the name suggests, it automates creation of a grid of dots, allowing you to easily customise the numbers of rows and columns, the grid spacing and dot diameter. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there must be other ways to achieve the same result (e.g. maybe using \u0026lsquo;tiled clones\u0026rsquo;), but this makes it super easy.\n I created the first version of the extension a few years ago and, if I recall correctly, it was very much inspired by a basic example python extension that was available at that point, but this is actually even simpler than that example as it is very specific in use. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in creating extensions there is some documentation.\nRecently, I updated a few aspects that were deprecated with the latest version of Inkscape and have uploaded it to github with some basic instructions on how to use it.\n https://github.com/moomop/inkscape_dot_grid\n Using the snap-to-grid alignment, each blank A4 page is set up with two 12.5 by 19 cm areas (26 dots by 39 dots) ready for cutting into A5 pages; these are postioned to give a little more space in the middle than at the edges, to allow for the space taken up by the punches, as well as some middle markers to aid cutting.\n2. Design the custom layouts If you are not going to buy a ready-made planner, of course you have so much flexibility to design what you want, but this can lead into an endless search for so-called \u0026lsquo;planner peace\u0026rsquo; as you tweak and re-tweak the design.\nMy preferred planning system is to plan things weekly, over two sides of paper (called a planner spread), so it’s on that basis that I make my main planner designs. I only have a mono singled-sided printer, which is why all my layouts are black-and-white.\nPlanner layout My main planning layout, after going through several iterations, is currently a to-do and shopping list left page, and dated right page. I’m right-handed, so having the right page as the main page means you can easily make a new note without removing the page. There’s a 1.5 cm header space at the top. I don’t have many day-specific tasks, so four slots is plenty! This leaves room for washi at the bottom of the A5 pages. Standard decorative kit box stickers are 1.5 inches across so, to allow those to fit well, the main space is 6.75 cm (to have dividing lines between days extend past the dots - which I just feel has more asthetic appeal) with decorative and sticker space on the edge of 4 cm.\n Journalling layout I also use my planner as my journal, although I’m very freeform with it, and a filled in page turns out as half planning and half journalling. For this layout, after the planner layout each week I have another spread for journalling. This is made a ‘horizontal’ format, and for me, demonstrating the advantages of designing your own layout, has more space, and not less on the weekends. The weekends are also designed to fit a happy planner box sticker (Sunday\u0026rsquo;s are 6.5 cm tall).\n 3. Add dates I used to go ahead and adjust the files with my layouts directly, and re-type the dates 52 (or maybe 53) times for each year, re-saving each time, but that quickly gets old. So now, there’s another script to modify each page and automatically add the dates (this script is specific to my files, but the basis of it can be thought of as a find-and-replace). This saves the pages with a numbered file name to keep them in order.\n4. Make a single PDF When all the pages for a year are ready, I convert them from SVGs into PDFs and combine them together as one file in the correct order for printing. This does require some thought as you want to minimise the number of paper sheets you waste, and with extra planner pages for monthly overviews, for me this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out so you can do it exactly with no waste, and I have a spare A5 page every month.\n5. Print and punch To stand up well to disc binding, the paper needs to be at least 100 gsm and non-recycled. When making your own planner, you can of course choose your preferred paper. I use 160 gsm Clairefontaine dcp; it’s very thick, although definitely paper and not card stock - in fact any heavier and my printer wouldn’t cope with it. Printing is quite time-consuming in a home set-up as you can’t just set it going and leave it. If you have a true double-sided printer, it would no doubt go a lot quicker.\nPrinting tips:\n Remember inkjet ink is water soluble - especially if you want to use any wet art media in your planner. When printing small pastel dots (mine are grey), then they won\u0026rsquo;t look like perfect circles on home printers, which use halftoning or dither to make the paler colours. You might need to fiddle with your printer\u0026rsquo;s quality setting, but bear in mind that what you notice when closely examining your planner pages, you don\u0026rsquo;t notice on a filled in sheet. If you are printing a single side at the time, note what side way round to load the pages by noting which side comes out as the top; then you are sure to load your paper in the correct way for the second side. Your print outs just won\u0026rsquo;t line up exactly between front and back, even from a double-sided printer. I check I am not too off, and don\u0026rsquo;t need to re-print a page, by holding up the paper and noting the alignment of the middle markers. Anything within a few mm won\u0026rsquo;t be noticeable when you make up the journal.  When you have your stack of printed A4 sheets, it\u0026rsquo;s time to chop it into the A5 pages. There are print shops that will cut it for you, but as those aren\u0026rsquo;t local to me, I next have the tedious job of using a paper trimmer. These aren\u0026rsquo;t the cheapest of gadgets, but are useful for all sorts of papercraft hobbies. I did quickly find that one with a rotary cutter is your friend for this process; blades in portable trimmers blunt very quickly.\n Printing (top is left!), cutting and punching of the planner pages\n  Then it\u0026rsquo;s on to punching. Not all discbound punches are created equal; although all of the systems are interchangeable to some extent, as the spacing between the mushrooms is always the same, the actual cut outs made vary.\nThe punch that is most talked about as being \u0026lsquo;the best\u0026rsquo; is made by Levenger, but it has a really hefty price tag to go with it. I\u0026rsquo;m using an Arc by Staples punch; the main criticism of this punch is that the stem on the holes are shorter than those in other systems, but with my paper it really does work well. This punch does have a stop, so lining up your paper is easy. You can also get disc punches that only do single sheets quite cheaply.\n6. Enjoy So after the work, here we are.

At 7 am it was raining, but this was already starting to clear up by the time Clare attended the marshall briefing by 8. And not much later, it turned sunny.\nClare volunteered for a \u0026lsquo;difficult\u0026rsquo; marshall position at the switchback in the middle of Norton Common where juniors take a different route to seniors, who have to do a U-turn at that point. As these groups are on the course at the same time as each other, Clare and another marshall needed to make sure everyone went the right direction\u0026hellip;\nMeanwhile, I was preparing for the start of my swim in the pool. As I still don\u0026rsquo;t have a trisuit, I laid out my North Herts Road Runners (NHRR) running vest in the transition area alongside my bath towel and was happy that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting soaked by a downpour.\nThe juniors set off first, starting at ~9 with their swim, and all went well for Clare encouraging them round the shorter 1 km laps. She was very impressed by their speed and/or determination.\nUpon her moving position to the switchback to make sure that the older runners didn\u0026rsquo;t follow the juniors, I am told there was bit of an oops as one of the relay runners [there is a relay option for teams of runners and swimmers] was directed to follow the juniors owing to some confusion relating to bib colours. Clare says many apologies to him!\n Back at the pool, these days there\u0026rsquo;s no strict order to how the adults start, and I started somewhere in the middle of the queue.\nDespite the warnings that the pool might be a bit \u0026lsquo;choppy\u0026rsquo; owing to the record number of participants, I had a smooth swim and mostly seemed to be in a gap in the field. That was right until the end of the last length when I was overtaken by a couple of faster swimmers and had a short delay waiting for the exit steps.\nTransition is always fun for me as I don\u0026rsquo;t practice the putting on the shoes and socks element like a true triathlete. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if they would bother with socks. but the one year I tried the 5 km without socks in my regular running shoes, I ended up with bleeding feet.\nOnce I finally had my running top on, I was off into more familiar territory, as the run is one I do most months.\nCompared to previous years' results, the swim was a little slower but maybe because of that I felt quite fresh on the run and my time didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be drastically different overall.\nAll in all, once again a great fun event, and it\u0026rsquo;s keeping up its record of always being on a nice sunny day.\n2021\u0026rsquo;s report Today saw the return of the Duck n Dash aquathlon for its 11th year. Aquathlon combines swimming and running (not to be confused with duathlon, which is run and bike, and definitely not with biathlon, which needs skis and a rifle). This is an annual favourite for me, combining a 400 m lane swim in the Letchworth outdoor pool with a 5 km run round Norton Common.\nIt was actually this event back in 2011 that inspired me to join a running club (not sure why not a swimming or triathlon club, but maybe running is just that bit more accessible) to see if I could get a bit faster. It\u0026rsquo;s also inspired me to swim a bit more frequently over the years, and I think it might have been training for the first Duck n Dash that first brought me to the outdoor pool at all.\n Lining up ready for the swim\n  Conditions were near perfect this morning, sunny but not too warm. The lack of rain (I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s rained for any of the 11 events so far) was probably for the best as I could imagine it making transition more challenging, especially for those of us who opt for the running vest option rather than a trisuit.\nThe swim (8 lengths of the 50m pool) has individual timed starts for each swimmer, and plenty of room for overtaking, so not too much risk of collision.\n  Length 7 of 8\n  Exiting the pool, we ideally pause only briefly for transition (aka the putting on of shoes and socks). In my case, putting on of the shoes, socks and running vest, maybe with a bit of towelling dry and/or wrestling with the vest to get the race number on display, is never totally the smoothest, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t quite felt the urge to invest in technological solutions to this for the 20 seconds I might save once a year.\nOnce that\u0026rsquo;s safely negotiated, the run is going to be very familiar to anyone used to the NHRR First Saturday of the Month 5k. There is a small extra detour down the middle of the common (to make up for the different start point) but otherwise the course is the same.\n Over the years, there have been various slight tweaks to the Duck n Dash format, but nothing that has affected the welcoming nature of this low-key multi-sport event. The swim/run distances have varied a little with early years including the \u0026lsquo;drake\u0026rsquo;, with a 600 m swim option and 6 km run. Since 2016 it has settled on the 400 m/5 km swim/run. The event has also seen the addition of age-group starts for juniors, some of whom I\u0026rsquo;m sure will go on to be the triathletes of the future. I remember the first year the event was run, it had to be early enough to be clear of the pool before it opened for regular swimmers at about 9 am. Today\u0026rsquo;s start time of 10:15 for the adult race seemed very relaxed in comparison.\n2021 result [and 22–24 from the future]    Year Event Swim Transition Run Total time Position     2024 Duck 00:08:38 00:01:16 00:20:44 00:30:38 22   2023 Duck 00:08:28 00:01:14 00:21:33 00:31:16 18   2022 Duck 00:08:24 00:01:03 00:20:56 00:30:24 13   2021 Duck 00:08:19 00:01:15 00:23:04 00:32:40 16     I think this shows my running [ed: in 2021] isn\u0026rsquo;t quite as strong as it has been, which I don\u0026rsquo;t find too surprising given the circumstances.\nTable of past Duck n Dash results We managed to put together a table of my results from previous years of the Duck n Dash.\n   Year Event Swim Transition Run Total time Position     2019 Duck 00:08:16 00:01:10 00:21:20 00:30:47 15   2018 Duck 00:08:24 00:01:16 00:21:35 00:31:17 10   2017 Duck 00:08:20 00:01:16 00:19:41 00:29:19 9   2016 Duck 00:09:42 null 00:20:15 00:29:57 8   2015 Drake 00:14:36 null 00:24:16 00:38:51 13   ????

London marathon don\u0026rsquo;t publish the number of ballot places that they have, but estimates I\u0026rsquo;ve read say it\u0026rsquo;s ~17,000. We do know that there are usually ~40,000 runners - although this has been increased to ~50,000 in 2021. They do also publish the numbers of applicants they get for the ballot, and that\u0026rsquo;s well over 400,000 (at least since they stopped it being so that you had to get up very early in the morning on one specific day to even submit an online ballot entry before applications closed).\nThe other runners comprise those getting places in return for a large (£1000s) charity fundraising commitment, via being a \u0026lsquo;good for age\u0026rsquo; or stronger runner, or via places that are assigned to running clubs affiliated with UK Athletics. In fact, it was on a club place that James ran his one and only marathon at London back in 2014 (3:20:22 for those that are interested).\n James running the London marathon back in 2014\n  This all equates to an ~4% change of success in the ballot every year, or that you would on average get a ballot place once in every 25 years. So when you see people saying about their 10 years of trying to get a place, then they are not unlucky. It\u0026rsquo;s just the numbers and the system; sure, maybe you could do things like not allow previous runners to apply for ballot places but numbers suggest doing that simply wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make it so you were suddenly loads more likely to get a place.\nSo why back in April 2019 did I decide to enter the ballot to run the London marathon? I’m honestly not sure, but a good deal of it was watching some friends cross the finish line and being caught up in the excitement, and a good deal of it was because it was so unlikely I’d actually get a place.\nSo, it was in complete shock at the enormity of what I was in for that made me shriek out loud when I saw the ‘congratulations’ email in October 2019. Then the hard work started\u0026hellip;\nOctober 2019 to March 2020 I’m not a likely marathon runner or indeed a likely runner at all; I only took up running in 2017 as part of a North Herts Road Runners (NHRR) couch-to-5k (C25K) group, and, before starting this first lot of training, I’d never run more than 10 km. However, I have been doing running on a regular basis since then, and I do feel my fitness is better for it.\n Me (back row, fourth from left) as part of the group photo celebrating a successful completion of C25K in 2017\n  Realistically, mind, there was never any possibility that fully running every minute of a marathon distance was going to be a sensible goal. So all along, with some help from coach Karen (thank you!), I devised training towards a run-walk plan.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t begin to say I remember all of what the training was like during this period, which is now over a year and a half ago. I do remember how much of all my spare time it took, how it was an \u0026lsquo;exciting\u0026rsquo; endeavour to get up Mondays after long-run Sunday and that I had perpetually sore muscles and sometimes worse hurts or niggles. Training didn\u0026rsquo;t go perfectly either; I had a cold during December 2019, which meant training had to stop for that month. I also remember being out running in some rather spectacular rain storms, although it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a particularly harsh winter.\nAnybody who thinks running is invigorating is sorely mistaken...  All in all though, there were no disasters and that meant throughout January and into February, I ran my first ever 10 miles and half marathon, and, to date, my longest run ever [17.2 miles and 4:04, or ~25 repeats of 8 minute run, 2 minute walk (Strava  activity; followers only)] was in mid-late Feb. After that one, I did have quite some fun to make it from the end to the fast food place for lunch, and then an even bigger struggle to get into the car to be driven home after lunch. Anybody who thinks running is invigorating is sorely mistaken, all it ever promotes in me is a strong desire for a nap. I remember then I was still hoping that it\u0026rsquo;d work out OK to run that April; the possibility that a pandemic would lead to a postponement was still distant.\nBut of course it wasn\u0026rsquo;t to be, and, eventually, even the marathon organisers accepted this and a postponement was planned, with the idea to hold the 2020 race in October 2020.\nSummer 2020 Immediately after the announcement of the postponement, I stepped back from running; this wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard because (a) I was bored of it, and (b) the rules were \u0026lsquo;essential exercise only\u0026rsquo;.\nAfter a few weeks, and some recovery in the aches, we had the 2.6 challenge, on the original date of the marathon - April 26th. Although fundraising was not and is not a big part of my doing a marathon, I did feel it was something that would help fill the hole in what charities were able to raise left from the overall cancellations of events. Keeping it simple, I stuck with 2.6 miles - I wasn\u0026rsquo;t at my fastest ever but I definitely gave it enough to be exhausted after - it comes from the thought that even modest fundraising means \u0026lsquo;people\u0026rsquo; will \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; the result (Strava  activity; followers only).\n After the 2.6 challenge\n  A few weeks after that, in May 2020, came the \u0026lsquo;purple marathon banana relay\u0026rsquo; - a virtual 10-person relay we did as part of my running group, one that was hours faster than one I\u0026rsquo;d do on my own. It still makes me smile the way the \u0026lsquo;banana\u0026rsquo; got fresher as the distance went up. Those who took part will understand!\nBut the real marathon was starting to hover over me - if it were to be done in October, training would have to start in earnest at some point. It\u0026rsquo;s just difficult to have motivation when it is difficult to believe something will happen.\nIt must be exceptionally hard to organise a major event during an ever-shifting health situation, and with continued speculation as to whether there was truly any possibility of the event going ahead in person. There was talk of a marathon being done with social distancing (the joke was 40,000 people at a distance of 2 m apart, and someone was on for 80 km to get to the start line); there were \u0026lsquo;nearly\u0026rsquo; promises for a decision being made on whether it would go ahead by a certain date, but never quite a yes or no. On 19th June, we got an update:\n  As I write, there are currently just over 15 weeks before the planned date of our 40th Race on Sunday 4 October. Therefore, on the usual timescale for our event, we are currently at the equivalent of the first week of January.\nThat means there is still plenty of time to train and there is neither a need, nor should there be a desire, to be at your peak fitness yet.  Hugh Brasher A message from the Virgin Money London Marathon Event Director   Maybe this rang true for a lot of marathon runners, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t for me. By then, my own feeling (and it\u0026rsquo;s not like I don\u0026rsquo;t have quite a strong knowledge of biology) was for a definite postponement being the safest thing; by the end of July, I was frustrated that a call either way hadn\u0026rsquo;t come.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t only my preference on safety in a pandemic though that made me favour postponing - there were published rules on sporting events. These included avoiding having baggage, a requirement for social distancing during travel, no mass starts, no spectators and no handing out of medals. Some of these to me were plain impossible for London and some would have meant that the experience would have to be so diminished as to make the whole thing a very poor show for anyone for whom this was going to be a once-only thing.\n On 6th August, it was confirmed that the 2020 London marathon would be virtual. It was also confirmed we could transfer our \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; places to either October 2021 or April 2022 (I chose 2022 - we\u0026rsquo;ll come back to this later), something that was not a legal requirement but would have been heartbreaking to many if it had not have been permitted - the luck I mentioned at the start on getting a ballot place would be unlikely to strike twice.\nI really wasn\u0026rsquo;t at first sure whether to participate in the virtual marathon. Even just walking with lots of proper \u0026lsquo;rest\u0026rsquo; breaks isn\u0026rsquo;t quite something that can be knocked out for a given day, and I\u0026rsquo;m not usually into doing something as a \u0026lsquo;challenge\u0026rsquo; as challenges can encourage you to make decisions that are not sensible (i.e. going out for 26.2 miles when you haven\u0026rsquo;t really done the training!). But eventually I decided, why not; we can\u0026rsquo;t predict the future, and to do this would be a memento of the successful hard work put in earlier in the year. And there would be a medal and t-shirt.\nAutumn 2020 So roll on October 4th. My aim was quite simple, start at 8am and finish before dark. However, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t quite counted on it turning out to be the wettest day of the year!\nI had decided to do the walk round the Greenway, partially through nostalgia, as it was where I\u0026rsquo;d done a lot of the earlier training, and partly because detours back to the house were possible to eat, change wet clothes, warm up etc.\nI did the obligatory pre-event making of the \u0026lsquo;flat me\u0026rsquo; clothes with race bib. [Although it\u0026rsquo;s only in blog research that I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt how there\u0026rsquo;s a term flat runner/flat me - before I was just \u0026ldquo;I need to do the making of these into the person shape for the photo!”.] I downloaded and set up the pre-race app. And then we were off (yep, James was with me to carry stuff).\n Flat me, James and me on the virtual marathon, and me with the t-shirt later\n  The special app to measure and record the distance had quite fun and well-thought out positive messages from Paula Radcliff and Steve Cram for us. What\u0026rsquo;s more, and somewhat to my surprise, the app actually worked for me, and the messages played at the correct distances (although most of the day, the continuous rain rather meant I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hear them). [Mind, I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually get the app recording the correct time, but as it actually cut 30 mins off the 9:36:42 it took, I was able to update to make the official time longer without any fuss after the event.]\nThe first flood was on the first of my three loops, near Radwell meadows; the second flood, on the second loop at near half-way was even worse, although in a more expected location. Many many miles of trudging through the rain with very wet feet. What was great was passing all the other people in various phases of running or walking their own marathons, and, of course, those who came out to give me specific encouragement (thank you too!).\nIt all ended with a few loops of a local playing field, which was also fitting as James and I had done a few other virtual events there too over the year.\nSpring and summer 2021 So where are we now; well, I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually been able to run much this year as I\u0026rsquo;m somewhat injured. And things are still very much up in the air, and not just with the fact we are still in a pandemic. Last week, the London organisers announced on social media that the marathon in 2022 won\u0026rsquo;t be back to April as was expected, but would rather also be planned for October.\n  I can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel emails should have gone out to those, like me, that were already signed up to run before - or at least at the same time as - these posts. Training for a marathon when you don\u0026rsquo;t usually run long distances takes over a lot of your life and this is a major change in that regard. It\u0026rsquo;s also fuelled speculation about whether this year will go ahead in about 40 day\u0026rsquo;s time, although they are just starting to announce specific plans and mitigations for the 2021 race to participants.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve yet to learn full details on the plan for 2022, but after the first message, which was rather celebratory in tone, the posts have been edited or supplemented, and we have learnt that those with original 2020 ballot places will be able to transfer to April 2023. I know I chose April 2022, rather than October 2021, in the first place because, for me, winter training is preferable. As someone put it, summer is rum, not run.\n[This] is already heading towards a three-year marathon  But then there is a strong feeling that what is already heading towards a three-year marathon would be better without it turning into three and a half years. I\u0026rsquo;m not getting younger.\nRight now, I can\u0026rsquo;t say whether I\u0026rsquo;ll be on the start line of a marathon either in a year and a bit\u0026rsquo;s time or six months after that.

Here are some notes on the process that I follow to make sourdough.\nSourdough starter As you may know, sourdough is a type of bread made using \u0026lsquo;wild\u0026rsquo; yeast. Before making your sourdough bread, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a sourdough starter. As part of the bread-making process, you grow the starter with flour, increasing its volume, and you should be able to save some for next time and in theory never run out.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve put a few notes on the starter below (and see the link in the \u0026lsquo;Extra shots\u0026rsquo; section), but sourdough starters are probably at least one topic all of their own and for this post I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on recording the steps I follow to create a loaf.\nThe levain The first stage is to grow the starter to form a fermenting flour/water mixture known as a \u0026lsquo;levain\u0026rsquo;. The montage below shows how this looks.\n About 50 to 100 g of starter saved from last time Add 150 g flour and 150 g water and stir Cover and leave to rise for a few hours (at least 3-4 hours depending on temperature) The levain has started to bubble. It would probably be ok to use at this stage I left it a further few hours, by which time it was foaming as seen in the last picture   Mixing the dough Transfer 300 g of the levain to the mixing bowl, add 450 g flour, a teaspoon of salt and about 225-250 ml water. Set the remaining levain aside to keep as the starter for next time.\n Mix the dough for 5 minutes on a low speed. After mixing it will still look fairly wet. It thens needs to ferment for several hours (I aim for about 4) before shaping into the basket. Preferably during this time fold every hour or so (in this case I only managed once). These foldings don\u0026rsquo;t seem too critical in my experience but generally seem recommended. I tip the dough onto a floured surface (you can shuffle more flour under it using the scraper if it tries to stick) and then stretch each side outwards and it fold over aiming to end up with a somewhat square piece of dough.\n Shaping Once the fermentation is done, I give the dough a final shaping and leave it to prove. I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly been proving my loaves in a round basket (as in the pics below). There are slightly different techniques for other shaped baskets and the basket isn\u0026rsquo;t essential (you can prove it on a cloth, maybe with a slightly drier dough in that case to avoid excessive flowing).\nIf using a basket, it\u0026rsquo;s best to flour that basket ready before you start folding. The basket can be generously floured to stop the dough sticking during the proving. Sprinkle flour into the basket from a slight height to spread evenly. It can help to hold the basket at an angle so that the part the flour is currently landing on is more horizontal.\nFor shaping into the round basket, the dough is first folded. Working round the dough, stretch out a piece of dough, fold it over to the far side, move round a bit and repeat until you\u0026rsquo;ve gone right round. I aim for 5 such folds.\nThen flip the dough and use your scraper and other hand to tidy the shape into a ball/boule. Use your scraper and hand to rotate the dough, pushing dough under the boule as you go and stretching the top surface. Finally, flip the dough again into the basket (so the side that was facing the work surface is now upwards in the basket)\nThe following pictures illustrate this part of the process:\n The basket before flouring The basket after flouring The dough after the first two folds The dough after all five folds The dough flipped and shaped into a boule The dough flipped again and placed in the basket   Proving Next, the dough needs to prove in the basket. You can either do this for about 4 hours at room temperature or arrange to get to this point at the end of the day and put the dough in the fridge to prove more slowly overnight. The overnight method has the advantage that the loaf is ready for baking first thing next morning so the bread is fresh the next lunchtime!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the loaf after proving overnight in the fridge:\n Baking Preheat the oven, then turn the loaf out onto a well floured baking tray. If the loaf has any trouble dropping from the inverted basket, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to use your fingers to loosen it.\nI should note that the use of the baking tray and a slightly moderate initial oven temperature (225°C) rather than a pizza stone and a fiercer temperature is a bit controversial. Supposedly it might result in a crust that is very slightly less crunchy, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to make a big difference to me. I started with the baking tray approach after my pizza stone broke clean in two mid-bake - before that I was using a temperature around 250°C. I\u0026rsquo;ve also not bothered with adding steam from a baking dish of boiling water. In my experience it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to make much difference to the end result and I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced it\u0026rsquo;s great for the electric oven. Right before putting it in the oven I score it with a grignette.\nBaking is for an initial 15 minutes at 225°C followed by 30 minutes at 180°C. Then remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack. During the early part of the bake, it\u0026rsquo;s likely to initially flow a little (don\u0026rsquo;t panic) before springing to it\u0026rsquo;s eventual shape.\nThe following pictures show:\n The grignette (aka lame) used for slashing the loaf The loaf turned out onto the floured baking tray before and after slashing The loaf flowing a little and then springing back in the oven   After cooling, it\u0026rsquo;s ready to eat. Here are some pictures showing it cooling on the rack and then cut to show the crumb:\n Eating Here are some sourdough egg and mayonnaise sandwiches made from the loaf:\n Recipe notes Starter To create a starter in the first place will take a few days during which you repeatedly ferment and replenish a flour/water mixture (approx 100% hydrated). As I understand it, there\u0026rsquo;s generally enough yeast present in the flour and/or your kitchen without having to go out of your way to add any. Once you have a starter going it can be kept dormant in your fridge potentially for months if required (i.e. if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to make sourdough for a little while)\nNot got too much detail to add on this part as it\u0026rsquo;s been months since we revived the starter that had been lurking at the back of our fridge for years. Or perhaps that one really was dead and we just started a new one, who knows\u0026hellip;\nIf I remember, correctly to create our original starter (back in the mists of time), we followed steps from a book that included adding the skin of an organic grape and potentially parading the starter in the yeasty air of the garden and doing a small dance. Pretty sure neither of those parts were necessary.\nIf your starter is working well the smell should be reminiscent of yoghurt. It seems that the starter contains a symbiotic mixture of yeasts and bacteria similar to those used for yoghurt.\nFlour With flour being the main ingredient it does seem plausible that choice of flour can make a big difference to the outcome. Ideally it generally seems recommended to use a strong (i.e. high gluten/protein) white bread flour for sourdough. I haven\u0026rsquo;t experimented with a lot of different flours, but did see noticeable differences between a generic \u0026lsquo;bread flour\u0026rsquo; (sold by the sack from the bakery of a local supermarket at the start of lockdown) and a high gluten flour marketed as \u0026lsquo;ideal for sourdoughs\u0026rsquo; (Marriage\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Chelmer White\u0026rsquo; ). The regular flour was able to make a perfectly serviceable sourdough loaf, but was able to hold a little less water in the dough before becoming sloppy and the loaves produced had a slightly less open texture.\nHydration Another key factor is the amount of water incorporated into the dough. Generally this hydration is expressed by bakers as a percentage of water to the weight of the flour. For the recipe above, there is a total of around 400 g of water (150 g from the levain + 250 g added before mixing) and 600 g flour (150 g from the levain + 450 g flour) giving a hydration of 66%. That seems to be towards the lower end of hydrations recommended for sourdough.\nI did experiment with higher hydrations, but found that they were harder to work, and more prone to flowing in the oven, without giving any better result. With a more hydrated dough (e.g. around 70%) it seems to be more important to fold the dough a few times during proving, but I\u0026rsquo;m doubting whether the improvement that gives comes from anything other than the flour that is incorporated during these folds.\nThe recipe I\u0026rsquo;m using here is similar to Marriage\u0026rsquo;s White Sourdough Loaf formula.\nReducing the water added at mixing to 225 g gives a hydration of 62.5% which is a little dryer still, but again easier to work with (ideal if you don\u0026rsquo;t expect to have time for much folding). This reduction in hydration didn\u0026rsquo;t have a big impact on the texture of the bread, but maybe makes it slightly more prone to bursting out into ear(s) away from the locations you\u0026rsquo;ve slashed.\n Extra shots  Discussion and study of sourdough starter bacteria and yeasts https://asm.org/Articles/2020/June/The-Sourdough-Microbiome Bake with Jack has a blog on bread and sourdough and also a baking equipment shop https://www.bakewithjack.co.uk/  ","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2021/08/sourdough_process/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself doing a more than average amount of baking over the last year or so, including bread and in particular sourdough.

Maybe even someone subscribes (via RSS) to this blog, not that I feel that\u0026rsquo;s very likely (we don\u0026rsquo;t know because we don\u0026rsquo;t track you). But it\u0026rsquo;s not just digital options where I\u0026rsquo;m not the only one to increase the number of subscriptions I have recently, with there being more and more physical product subs to choose from.\n My most long-standing sub is to a monthly sticker kit, but in this post I review my subscription to a few boxes from SimplyCook, a recipe kit subscription. The sub itself is about providing three pots of spices, herbs, stocks etc., together with a simple recipe, with the aim of making it easy to break out of a rut in the cooking of midweek meals, with all the dishes billed as only taking 20 minutes to cook. You shop for all the fresh products, carbs and other canned stuff.\nEach time your sub is sent, at a minimum frequency of once per month, you get to choose from a selection of four of ~100 options available; forget to do that and they send you a kit based on some initial preferences about what spice level you\u0026rsquo;re happy with.\nMost of the recipes are just too lacking in ummph  Although, at first, these proved enjoyable, the overall thought is this isn\u0026rsquo;t one to keep with long term. Most of the recipes are just too lacking in ummph, and feel watered down, especially in terms of heat, yet heavy on salt, compared with how I\u0026rsquo;d want them to be. This means I know that many of the recipes I didn\u0026rsquo;t try are going to be a disappointment - they even state how they\u0026rsquo;ve made Jerk chicken, which must be fiercly hot with Scotch bonnet chilli for me, a \u0026lsquo;two-chilli\u0026rsquo; (out of three) heat dish, probably so as to not scare people off.\nI also tended to avoid the Korean-style recipes, given that I\u0026rsquo;d usually have gochujang and doenjang sauces obtained far cheaper in the pantry. Finally, as new recipes aren\u0026rsquo;t added often, it just gets samey.\n One other thing to note is that some of the recipes are also far too optimistic on cooking time, to the extent you could have raw meat or potato, plus some recipe cards also miss cruicial details. However, it\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to use some basic cookery skills to make sure they turn out more-or-less as intended.\nWhere I do think some of the kits could come into their own is to have in the store cupboard for something to bring out when you\u0026rsquo;re short of the time needed to simmer a stew or curry enough to develop the needed flavour, so as the taste isn\u0026rsquo;t a bit raw spice. They also would be good to take into situations where you don\u0026rsquo;t have your usual pantry, say as part of a self-catering holiday.\nIf you do want to consider buying some kits - noting that you can usually get introductory offers for a trial box - my reviews as left as feedback on the SimplyCook website are below. Five stars is given for a dish that is definitely worth considering; three stars means neither better nor quicker than making from scratch, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother with it.\ntl;dr is I\u0026rsquo;d pick Japanese seared steak, spicy bean chilli, chicken makhani and jambalaya for my first four options.\nReviews of individual kits  5 stars out of 5  Chicken chilli chowder Lovely simple winter meal. A little warmth to make it something a bit different here. I perhaps would prefer a more New England style thickness to make it hearty but not so rich. Possibly just more cornflour.\nChicken makhani Indulgent but very mild curry. It does have a feel of ready meal about it as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t end up with much freshness or zing, but that certainly has its place.\nChurrasco chicken I really enjoyed all three elements of this; I was worried the piri piri wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have enough heat given most things SimplyCook seem to be made very mild (even with a hot rating) but it does have just about enough. The sweetcorn was an interesting twist for the recipe too.\nFirecracker chicken noodles The sauce does have heat - absolutely perfect to liven up a basic noodle stir fry. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t benefit from holding back with it; it\u0026rsquo;s great to have something spicy from SimplyCook, and its still far from mad hot as part of the dish as a whole. Good flavour from the other pots and by adding sesame oil here too. I probably could get a similar effect without the kit but using it does makes it easy to balance the sweet and star anise flavours as well as the hot sauce.\nHot cajun meatballs Meatballs in tomato sauce flavoured with paprika, garlic, herbs with this Cajun-style kit. What\u0026rsquo;s not to like here? It\u0026rsquo;s not especially hot; nothing SimplyCook ever seems to be - so if you like spicy you could add more chilli/a little cayenne. It\u0026rsquo;s super easy to use chopped up sausages instead of meatballs too for variety.\nJambalaya Tastes pretty much how it does when I cook this from scratch, but so easy with the kit. Has a lot of flavour, although that\u0026rsquo;s not just from the kit but chorizo and prawns as great ingredients. Not hot, but some paprika spice. Very good.\nJapanese seared steak Yes, this kit uses expensive ingredients, so it would be hard to not be excellent, but the kit really made it a little different from a usual steak and mushroom; some spice on the meat, some flavour from the mushroom rice, and a different and delicious sauce to go with it all. Only negative for me is it\u0026rsquo;s just a little too salty.\nPork tacos al pastor Needs the extra pickle to make it great, but this one has proper flavour, mainly from the beans. The hot sauce doesn\u0026rsquo;t make the dish too hot in any way; just a little extra kick (i.e. it\u0026rsquo;s far from Tabasco-type heat). I did use shoulder steaks for the pork, and feel fillet would be too dry.\nSpicy bean chilli It does indeed make a spicy and richly flavoured chilli, with great chipotle-style smokiness; in fact it\u0026rsquo;s exactly as you\u0026rsquo;d expect it to be from the description. It\u0026rsquo;s not super hot once you eat with rice but it does merit a three-chilli rating unlike some so-called spicy kits that turn out bland and mild.\n 4 stars out of 5  Beef rendang This is nothing at all like a rendang, as that\u0026rsquo;s a completely different cut of meat and is slow cooked, meaning this kit produces far less flavour. However, it makes a fairly simple and quick beef and coconut curry with some Indonesian style. As you need good quality steak it is always going to be nice - whether it\u0026rsquo;s really worth it to add the curry sauce to such good starting ingredients I\u0026rsquo;m not sure on.\nBeef stroganoff Stroganoff is always a special treat, and the kit makes a nice enough cream paprika mushroom sauce (exceptionally mild). However, I found the potatoes disappointing. I like the idea of horseradish but it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t pack any sort of flavour, when you\u0026rsquo;d think such a powerful ingredient would come through quite strongly. Overall, this makes the dish somewhat disappointing and too bland. Might go for it again owing to the ease of making the dish.\nCa kho to Flavoursome with ginger/fish sauce/garlic, and sweet to make it feel Vietnamese, but not only salty, as some of these SimplyCook recipes can be. Not at all hot. I had not cooked with coconut water before, so this was an interesting use of flavour without the fat of coconut milk. I added some squid to give a better texture than I think it would be with soft white fish only.\nChipotle glazed pork Too salty, but otherwise a nice (and super quick) smoky bean stew, which accompanied pork particularly well; it would probably be a bit lacklustre without chorizo though. I feel it needs an extra side dish to make a complete supper e.g. a green salad.\nCrispy chilli beef I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting this to be like a takeaway, as that\u0026rsquo;s not possible to do without deep frying. However, I found the little bit of cornflour (yes, cornflour is missing in the ingredients) and very much more beef (best with a good quality steak) much nicer than the standard takeaway all-batter shreds, and liked that a lot. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do grated carrots again - although they cooked quickly, they just turned to mush; they would have been much better as matchsticks despite increasing prep. Also not quite enough chilli sauce to make it feel as indulgent as you\u0026rsquo;d hope.\nGoan fish curry This kit gave a good flavourful coconut-based curry. It\u0026rsquo;s quite mild as you\u0026rsquo;d expect from a Goan sauce, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t bland, and went very well with the fish and tomato. I\u0026rsquo;d like to try it with full-fat coconut milk to see if I could get the sauce thicker.\nLouisiana linguine Creamy pasta dish, with some depth to it, mainly from wine and stock rather than spices, making it mild. Would have felt less French and more Louisiana with the addition of more paprika or cayenne pepper.\nMexican beef quesadilla It makes nice quesadillas no question, but it\u0026rsquo;s not really special enough to justify the price over basic pantry seasonings and sauces. Not an instant to bother with again.\nMexican pulled chicken Difficult to rate this - the outcome is actually great. Really easy, and pulled chicken baps are not something I\u0026rsquo;d have thought to do and they come out tasty (although watch the cooking times; as I very much expected you needed lots longer than it said not to have raw potato and chicken). But it\u0026rsquo;s just the only flavour is chipotle (both for coleslaw and chicken). Only really got basic seasoning off the potato. Of course sweet potatoes are not going to go crispy, so expected that. Overall, good recipe but no more than I could have done with chilli en adobo sauce and salt.\nMoghul chicken korma Kit makes a fairly good korma that is a little fresher than a supermarket sauce. It\u0026rsquo;s just a bit too bland and even a very mild curry should be a bit \u0026lsquo;more\u0026rsquo;.\nMoqueca de peixe A pleasing and quick fish stew made different from Asian/Indian coconut curries by the addition of tomatoes. Spices here gave pleasant warmth to make it lively, but not hot.\nSeekh kebabs with gunpowder potatoes Well developed with herbs and spices, although not hot and could take more heat. Cumin is especially prominent. What elevated it from what I\u0026rsquo;d cook myself was the chutney to drizzle over at the end.\nSouth Indian salmon I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure about a cream-based sauce with salmon as opposed to a coconut curry but actually I did really like this one. Not any heat, but definite flavour from the spice and it all worked well together as a dish with the roast veg and spinach. The cauli and potatoes need to be very small to cook in the time quoted; maybe blanching first and having them bigger would be better. My main criticism though is that some of the spices are very coarsely ground, which on the whole I like, but here if you do crunch down on those you get a bitter hit.\nTamil black pepper chicken Slightly spiced meat and yoghurt, and onion flavour rice, with a quick easy marinade. A good sour flavour in this one (tamarind?) but not as exciting as a really good curry.\nWest African peanut stew Very rounded for a \u0026lsquo;stew\u0026rsquo; cooked so quickly with a nice consistency sauce. The method to cook the okra was also great - they didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out at all slimy. I\u0026rsquo;m just not too sure about the cocoa flavour given this didn\u0026rsquo;t have any sort of heat. A really interesting one, definitely not something I\u0026rsquo;d have done without the kit.\nYemeni lamb pilaf Quite a fair amount of spice, which transports you to the food of the region. The mint dressing was a nice twist. However, could also do with a whack of fresh chilli and lemon to boost it to something that\u0026rsquo;s not just ordinary (it\u0026rsquo;s very mild otherwise), which I always find disappointing after buying the kit for the spices already. Also a pity so heavy on the salt in the rice that it overpowers the rest. Nice enough to consider again but not very special.\n 3 stars out of 5  Chicken katsu curry It\u0026rsquo;s tasty enough if you really have no clue how to make a katsu curry from scratch but not a patch on the equally easy recipe (simple ingredients) released by a well-known brand in 2020. Weird use of a Korean sauce to give flavour. Very meh with the pickle too - just ridiculously low in acid so it tasted wet, when could have been a good accompaniment. 3 stars because wouldn\u0026rsquo;t buy again - neither easier nor more flavoursome than going it alone.\nCuban prawn pasta Can\u0026rsquo;t get excited about this; it makes a nice cream prawn pasta but prawns are an excellent and expensive ingredient that would be hard to go wrong with. Nothing to set it apart from what you\u0026rsquo;d make without a kit except a few orange granules in the mojo seasoning, It\u0026rsquo;s also exceptionally mild, nowhere near its \u0026lsquo;medium\u0026rsquo; rating, so to get much flavour you end up adding more chilli. Can\u0026rsquo;t see bothering with this again.\nSichuan dan dan noodles Just meh. Not hot, not enough flavour and rather dry. Quick but neither easier nor better than a stir-fry with store cupboard stuff.\nSicilian roast chicken Lemon and herb chicken and cooked lettuce - yep, that\u0026rsquo;s as you\u0026rsquo;d expect and nice eating, if very predictable. Then, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the mash; something was bitter about, but it was not strongly flavoured so OK as part of the meal. It was livened up a bit with drizzle, but not enough to go for again.\nVietnamese pork The meaty/beef flavour to the rice was an interesting twist, but you only get ginger and garlic out of the rest of the flavour, and something slightly sour; might be tamarind, might be lime juice. Very little chilli. The rest is just sugar and salt. A little underwhelming. I\u0026rsquo;d have liked more ummph, especially on the chilli. Easy but only OK.\n","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2021/07/simplycook_review/","summary":"Subscriptions are everywhere\u0026hellip; music, tv, software\u0026hellip; you even are, in a way, a subscriber to social media content, notwithstanding that you aren\u0026rsquo;t very in control of what you see there.

First of all, there\u0026rsquo;s the disruption of the update itself, waiting for something to download and restart until I get my program back, no doubt occurring at the most inconvenient moment. But then there\u0026rsquo;s also just that it is a change. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I genuinely hate change of course; it\u0026rsquo;s more that I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen into a habit of things being in a particular place or looking a certain way, and there\u0026rsquo;s something frustrating in the process of getting used to a new system.\n Of course many updates are necessary to address security issues and other bugs. Other updates are necessary because designs do fail in the user experience (UX), and developers should be looking to improve this. For instance, the template for this blog didn\u0026rsquo;t initially have the logos redirecting back to the home page, which breaks a convention; if even I, who knew the design, kept going to an \u0026lsquo;about\u0026rsquo; page accidentally, then that clearly would happen to visitors. So it needed to be redone. In other cases, however, it\u0026rsquo;s not that you\u0026rsquo;ve got something broken to fix up, but more about adding enhancements to the software.\nWhatever the reason for the change, it usually just takes a few hours or days with a new version for it all to click back into place. Then you get up and running, hopefully even with some new functionality that you can start to take advantage of. And you find that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t change back.\nUnfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s not just a minor fail in UX or something that I can get used to with Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s latest release of Word 365 and the complete redesign to the way comments work. This appears to be a case of an update that has been made with one set of users in mind, and perhaps not realising or testing how it would play out to another set of users.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been clear that over the past year there\u0026rsquo;s been a dramatic increase in the use of instant messaging and video conferencing systems at home and work, with Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s solution being Teams. And that\u0026rsquo;s where the idea for this update, the so-called \u0026lsquo;modern comments’ obviously comes from. What has happened is Word comments have been adjusted so as to make them like a social media comment or IM; you are no longer making a comment, you are starting a conversation!\n The issue comes in that editors aren\u0026rsquo;t starting a conversation. We\u0026rsquo;re, on the whole, not working in real time with others. We\u0026rsquo;re working on our own, using a functionality that has existed for decades with the goal of, at the end of our work, having an edited document that includes clear, detailed and formatted comments, with that document then usually taken away to be worked on elsewhere.\n  These new commenting experiences are ideal for today’s remote teams who may be working together from across town or around the world  Microsoft Introducing Modern Comments in Microsoft Word   A detailed look at modern comments reveals many features that are painful for editors, which have been elegantly summarised by Cybertext, and I agree with much of what is written there.\nThe \u0026lsquo;features\u0026rsquo; that I find to be far the worst though are related to editing of comments, spellcheck and formatting.\nIn order to edit a comment, where you used just to be able to click in your comment and start typing, now you have to click on a three dots menu, click edit, do your edit, click post. It\u0026rsquo;s even worse if you want to edit someone else\u0026rsquo;s comment from an earlier version of Word, as you have to go through a warning about how you will potentially lose formatting that was available but now isn\u0026rsquo;t (yes, you can no longer have anything but bold, italics, underline and highlight in your comments; tough if you dare to want to use a superscript, it will drop back out into plain text).\n Screenshots of editing Word modern comments\n  Spell checking also appears to be designed on the assumption that once you\u0026rsquo;ve \u0026lsquo;posted\u0026rsquo; your comment, you won\u0026rsquo;t be needing to check it much or do substantial adjustments to anything you\u0026rsquo;ve already written (i.e. that the conversation has moved on). However, reworking of comments is something editors do all the time as meanings becomes clear in later sections of documents, and you have to go back and change what you previously decided to convey.\nSo, although, while you are first writing your comment, you do, thankfully, get your usual squiggly spellcheck underlines to indicate the errors, once you go out of your comment, then come back and enter via the edit option, you only get squiggles in new text. And don\u0026rsquo;t think you can rely on spell checking the entire document at the end; that won\u0026rsquo;t pick up any errors in your comments.\n Speelllling (twice)\n  Finally, if you want to repeat stuff from another comment, better make sure you copy the text you want to use first. No leaving a blank a comment to mark your place and copying in from other comments; no, they are are all \u0026lsquo;locked\u0026rsquo; because a user (only it\u0026rsquo;s you because you\u0026rsquo;re working on your own) has a comment in progress. It is true you can at least copy-paste text in from the main document or the web - and also true that you will need to. You can\u0026rsquo;t use the special characters menu from within modern comments, so cue some scrolling around to find that β symbol you used four paragraphs ago - although, watch out, because, sometimes, but not always, those will become \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo;s in your comments.\nSo, how to deal with this change. First, we as editors can complain. Microsoft does have an in-app feedback method that gives you the opportunity to say how you don\u0026rsquo;t like something. You can also add your voice to the ever-growing thread on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s tech community blog post on modern comments, and then there\u0026rsquo;s always that bastion of social media complaint forums, otherwise known as twitter (#rollbackmoderncomments, #microsoft_modern_comments_suck etc.).\nI have also, over the days I\u0026rsquo;ve been \u0026lsquo;getting used to\u0026rsquo; to this new version, found a few tips that are helping me deal with the this productivity-zapping change. There\u0026rsquo;s a shortcut key (Ctrl + Enter) that you can use to post your comment. And I have got into going back into posted comments, without any of the nonsense of the three dots, from the reviewing pane.\n Screenshot of alternative comment views\n  Unfortunately, because the reviewing pane is a separate window, the one shown on the far left here (the middle view shows how you can see your comments as a list, for whatever reason you might want that\u0026hellip;), you don\u0026rsquo;t get any contextual information on the location of your comments from that view, limiting how useful it is (nor any spell checking at all).\nSo right now, it\u0026rsquo;s just waiting and hoping to see if Microsoft pay any attention to our feedback. Good news on that so far is a promise for some \u0026lsquo;legacy\u0026rsquo; features returning, and we might soon (well in at least 3-4 months) be able to get into the \u0026lsquo;edit\u0026rsquo; mode via a \u0026lsquo;hover\u0026rsquo; over the comments, saving all of one of the newly introduced clicks in the process of editing your comment!\n  Quick Edit: We will make it easier to enter edit mode for a comment such as showing the edit button on hover.

And although design can be just going with your preferred template for the content, I want a little more input than that because I do just want a \u0026lsquo;feel\u0026rsquo; that says \u0026lsquo;coffee now\u0026rsquo; to me, like when you\u0026rsquo;re sat on the sofa with a coffee.\nFirst, both James and I were sure the home page should just comprise recent posts, not a separate intro page; by far the most likely reader is in fact me or James, followed by friend or family - this isn\u0026rsquo;t a niche blog, there\u0026rsquo;s no effort been made on search engine optimisation (SEO) and no social-media-promoting activity, just personal musings. And I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t need me introducing to me.\nAt this point, it was a case of going through the Hugo themes to find one that appealed. At first we looked at tranquilpeak; however, using this came with some doubts, including on the licence (GPL vs MIT), on technical complexities and some just questioning the look. We are now using PaperMod.\n When you think about blog post home pages, although there\u0026rsquo;s some more-involved stuff you can do with areas set aside to present featured posts or scene-setting stuff, the basic decision is on the positions of the posts and the position of the navigation.\n The PaperMod theme uses a top navigation and has a list format for posts. My preference is for a simple list, as I feel it\u0026rsquo;s a less-cluttered look, with a far more-obvious relationship between the date of the post and where it appears on the page than with a tiled look. Sidebars are still very common on blogs, but that often seems to be because they are seen as a place to put adverts.\nThere are some features of the PaperMod theme that are great for our blog (for instance it has a search, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t realise was even possible for static sites), but there are some other features that we\u0026rsquo;d like which are currently missing. For example, we want to show thumbnails on the post summaries on the front page, we\u0026rsquo;d like to find an image gallery and plan to make the navbar and image handling more responsive for use on mobile.\nHaving surveyed several of the freely available Hugo themes, it seems apparent that while certain customisation is straightforward, if you want precise control of the look of your site then you will need to do some work to achieve this. There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of work ahead to convey \u0026lsquo;coffee now\u0026rsquo; comfort.\nSo, back to other choices, rather than a search for a perfect theme. First colours, and what I\u0026rsquo;ve gone for, and it was me choosing here, is some darker and mid-tone teals and coral, along with some neutrals. One thing I\u0026rsquo;m keen on is making sure the tone is not too gendered. Although there are some pink websites that are very appealing (one of my favourite sticker shops, papershire, is all about the pink), there\u0026rsquo;s no doubt they do often feel feminine to me, and this isn\u0026rsquo;t my blog - it has content from James too.\n Second, fonts. Although there are many thousands of fonts, it\u0026rsquo;s really not easy to pick out the ones that work best. There are great resources out there on fonts, with Google fonts hosting about a thousand freely licenced fonts in itself. For the body text, it\u0026rsquo;s obviously best to avoid anything too stylised, and, honestly, even though I have an aversion to the \u0026lsquo;g\u0026rsquo;s in some fonts, looking at you Trebuchet MS, the differences are so subtle that I can\u0026rsquo;t think the reader really notices, and you begin to feel, well maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a case for just using a websafe font (one likely to be available to on all browsers, think, Arial, Verdana, Helvetica etc.; I went to the bother of styling these - did you notice?) after all. [I\u0026rsquo;ve just noted that none of these supposed websafe fonts are available on our current version of ubuntu by default, but it uses something similar.]\nBut then I found a company that had a post about work their designers had done showing 50 Google font pairings for real to give a idea of how the fonts truly work in action, and that helped us pick a heading font and body font to use.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s still work to do, but if I were to wait for perfection here, the blog would never be live. So in true \u0026lsquo;website under construction\u0026rsquo; mode here\u0026rsquo;s a list of to-dos to help me keep track:\n Privacy policy Add thumbnails to summary cards Sort floating images for mobile viewing Change text sizes for mobile Update navbar Favicons Comment up css so it\u0026rsquo;s clearer Add JavaScript image gallery and lightbox  [note from the future - all done!]\n Extra shots  Choosing blog colours\nhttps://designyourownblog.com/how-to-choose-colors-blog-website/ More on website colours\nhttps://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design Colours scheme app\nhttps://coolors.co Dafont font resource\nhttps://www.dafont.com   Credits  Top image: Technology vector created by stories - www.freepik.com; designed by slidesgo/Freepik  ","permalink":"https://coffeenow.moomop.uk/post/2021/06/setting_up_blog_ii/","summary":"In my previous post about setting up the blog, we were at the stage of having decided on, and got at least somewhere, with getting Hugo working to generate a website, but with much design still to do.

But now, after following along with a tutorial published by Holly Pixels (update from the future: no longer available), I\u0026rsquo;ve at least got somewhere on it.\nIn the tutorial, for Procreate for iPad, the first thing required is to gather two elements - a new font to use for your text and an image with some foliage on a transparent background.\nI selected a font called ‘Louis George Cafe’ from Dafont [note, as with programs, so-called malicious fonts can be used to attack your computer and install malware, so take usual care with where you download them from]. Given this is only a hobby practice project, I can’t justify paid-for clipart, and, as most images with free-to-use licenses are JPEGs, rather than PNGs, my next task was to remove background from a JPEG image retrieved from Unsplash.\n Selecting areas of background to remove\n  Having, got that done, if a bit messily, it was fairly easy to install the font into Procreate and create two layers, one with my foliage image underneath and with the top layer being my text – \u0026lsquo;Coffee now\u0026rsquo;.\n Coffee with foliage underneath rasterised text layer\n  The next steps involve using a layer mask, and here’s where the tutorial assumed a bit more knowledge than I had, as the only masks I knew of were ‘alpha lock’ and ‘clipping masks’, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the reference to using black. So cue a bit of looking up on that.\nLayer masks for Procreate are masks that act on the particular layer you attach them to (no surprise there I guess) and you can only use black, white and grey on them, which denotes areas where you hide or show elements from the layer:\n painting with black hides the material from the layer painting with white shows your layer painting with grey creates opacity on the layer according to the value of the grey  This means, if you are pixel perfect with your brush, all you need to do to create your artwork is create a layer mask for the text layer, paint in black in the correct place on that mask and your foliage will appear above your text.\nHowever, there’s a clever way to make it so your black paint can only go in areas of foliage. First, you create your mask layer for the text, then go back to your foliage layer, auto select on the foliage, then, without clicking away from your selection, go back to your mask layer. Then you can only paint the black where the selection is active. No more painting in the lines. I fell down at this step a couple of times by making my selection before creating the layer mask - this pre-creates the mask with black and white areas according to what is selected, so could be useful, but wasn’t what was going to work here.\n Coffee now hidden by black on a layer mask\n  And with a little bit of background added, that’s the end of the tutorial…\n Final image\n  I can see I could want to try this again for images with people.

Unfortunately, it also did the same on my return to running club this week; sunny before, sunny after, but during a torrential thunderstorm. Two days later and I might be dry but my trainers are still sopping. It\u0026rsquo;s also the day parkrun, a worldwide organisation that helps volunteers run free, weekly, timed 5k events, of which there are hundreds in the UK have confirmed their events won\u0026rsquo;t be back in England on June 5th; but more on that later.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because first, I want to talk about extrapolation. Ok maybe that sounds a bit dull, but it\u0026rsquo;s an important point. Bear with me. Especially as this is where the giants and chocolate bars come in. Extrapolation is the process by which you take data from results you are seeing as a current trend and use it to predict what might be the case for data outside of that range, or, more simply, when you use stuff you know to predict stuff you don\u0026rsquo;t. But it can easily go wrong - imagine if we were to take data on everybody\u0026rsquo;s height from birth to age 16 and extrapolate to age 40, well I\u0026rsquo;d be very tall, indeed a veritable giant.\nAnd chocolate bars? This is even worse. They could go extinct! Ok, I\u0026rsquo;m being dramatic – that\u0026rsquo;s not likely. You only come to that conclusion if you do an extrapolation. It was back in 1983 that Stephen J. Gould, a popular science author, published an essay in his book Hen\u0026rsquo;s Teeth and Horse\u0026rsquo;s Toe on how the Hershey bar would be so small by December 1998 that it would cease to exist. This is because he had data that showed how every time the chocolate bar was reintroduced at a new larger size, it was actually smaller than the last time such a new larger size was introduced after years of what is now termed shrinkflation. The essay is actually more on economics than anything else, but I\u0026rsquo;m somewhat sorry that the Hershey bar does still exist. I don\u0026rsquo;t like Hershey chocolate at all, yet somehow, if I find it offered, I still get tempted to check this again by actually having some.\n So back to running and parkrun. It has always been the case that I was supportive of parkrun as a positive thing in my life; no doubt, I\u0026rsquo;ll do a blog post on my running journey at some point to explain more.\nBut over the past few weeks, parkrun HQ are falling into the trap of extrapolating and ignoring caveats. In order to support the planned return of their events in England in early June 2021, parkrun commissioned an expert to assess whether their events would be safe, something to be commended. The report can be found here. But then came the press releases: \u0026lsquo;Independent studies show exceptionally low risk of infection and transmission’, \u0026lsquo;which [would result] in only 0.015% of runners potentially acquiring a COVID-19 infection’ and, most strangely of all, \u0026lsquo;Despite overwhelming evidence that parkrun events are amongst the safest activities people can participate in…’.\nThe problem is all these statements are extrapolated based on the original study. Dig down into the details and you\u0026rsquo;ll find the study is for an average parkrun size, 286 people, performed on a wide singular lap and where people rigorously follow protocols. Everyone knows parkruns aren\u0026rsquo;t mostly like that. You can\u0026rsquo;t extrapolate from such a study to justify the statements in press releases.\nSo if you can\u0026rsquo;t easily extrapolate from this type of study, how do you judge if it might be sensible to allow mass start running races without social distancing in the current times. And here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets positive, you can do real-world trials to test it. And even more positively, these are actually ongoing.\nIt really looks like all that we need is a little more patience, and we can have our favourite race events back up and running. Meanwhile, 30 of us can get together and go for a park run, aka a run in the park.

WordPress (meaning software available at https://wordpress.org, not to be confused with WordPress.com; see below) is a very common open-source content management system (CMS) for creating websites, including, but far from limited to, those dedicated to blogging. Not only that, but there are thousands of templates and plug-ins available, some free, some paid for, for you to paste (drag and drop) your content into at one end and get a site out the other, and it all claims it only takes minutes. It\u0026rsquo;s very tempting those sleek professionally designed styles set up and pre-done for you. And I\u0026rsquo;m not averse to (moderately) paying for templates, far from it, (good) graphic design is not easy and can be worth it. But it\u0026rsquo;s also the case that you very quickly run into how WordPress is a very complicated way of running a simple blog.\nBehind its interface, WordPress uses PHP and a MySQL database to create your website. Now you certainly do not necessarily need to know how to write scripts or much about SQL to use the system, and PHP/MySQL is a perfectly normal way to run a website - in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s the way I used to run a website back in the early 2000s. However, it also means a lot of behind the scenes computing going on in the hosting server every time someone looks at one of your posts. Certainly for the few bits of text, silly photos and maybe the odd embedded video that is all I can ever see anything I blog about amounting to.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a few other disadvantages to using WordPress. For a start, hosting a WordPress blog for for free via WordPress.com - the commercial wing of WordPress - is a definite no from me owing to the terms that allow them to reuse your content, plus serving ads you have no control over on your site. Then there\u0026rsquo;s the difficulty making CSS changes, no ability to use JavaScript plugins and it all being quite impossible to deviate even slightly from what your template has planned for you without payments that can add up.\nBut even going for paid-for options to avoid such limitations (ignoring full self hosting, which is too much a security minefield), this route isn\u0026rsquo;t right for \u0026lsquo;coffee now\u0026rsquo; because it also loses you so much creativity, plus it is difficult to keep it all backed up and in check. Half the \u0026lsquo;fun\u0026rsquo; (OK and not a little of the stress) of this blog, is for James and me to (try) and present stuff how we want it presented, and, even if it comes out a bit amateurish, that there\u0026rsquo;s learning in the trying. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s important for us to go the way of no cookies, no ads, no tracking of visitors, no social media-required loss of privacy (well, maybe not totally; I\u0026rsquo;m sure videos will be YouTube - we\u0026rsquo;ve not unlimited bandwidth you know!).\nSo what other options are out there. How much time could you actually dedicate to messing around with unruly, uninterpretable code to make what you want if you were only starting with raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript?\nWell, as that\u0026rsquo;s not for us either, there\u0026rsquo;s a compromise option - static site generators - and there\u0026rsquo;s several to choose from. See the list at Jamstack.\n This site uses one such generator - Hugo (no, not the film, not even the \u0026lsquo;human genome organisation\u0026rsquo;, which is most likely where I\u0026rsquo;m trying to go when I say Hugo). What the Hugo software does is take content written in markdown - think simple plain text email, so it\u0026rsquo;s super easy to write - perform some magic using a chosen template and spit out fully formatted HTML files, and it really does only take milliseconds to do that. These files are then ready to plop onto your host, and no processing on the server is required when you get a visitor (making the costs of running the blog much cheaper).\nHowever, I have found this route is subjecting me to a fair bit of headache-inducing techy stuff from the get go. [More coffee, right now, please.]\nFor a start, although there\u0026rsquo;s not much to learning markdown - apart from maybe working with a text editor and not a word processor - there\u0026rsquo;s the getting your actual blog content into a git repository, a version control system, so you don\u0026rsquo;t lose track of where you are. No denying, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to use git. So at the moment, this is a bit of an issue and definitely something I need to learn, and it\u0026rsquo;s not the easiest.\n Then, you are onto an awful lot of fiddling and adjusting of settings from within your chosen Hugo template, noting that you only get some 300 templates to choose from, not thousands. But even having chosen your template, set up it\u0026rsquo;s config file and got your content into the right place, so it might seem ready, some basic issues, such as if you want more than one author for your blog, means it\u0026rsquo;s likely not. There\u0026rsquo;s playing around with the \u0026lsquo;partials\u0026rsquo;, discovering you need more configuration parameters that sound scary to the uninitiated (namely, one called safeMode: unsafe - OK it\u0026rsquo;s not scary really, it just means the Hugo software allows you break out into real HTML in your markdown text when you need it, which is fine if you trust the person writing the HTML), enabling \u0026lsquo;pipelines\u0026rsquo;, understanding shortcodes\u0026hellip; Plus, in our case the JavaScript isn\u0026rsquo;t all as ready in the chosen template as we\u0026rsquo;d like either. [I don\u0026rsquo;t know JavaScript any more than git of course! And that\u0026rsquo;s not one I\u0026rsquo;m about to learn just yet].\nBut, some typing, some cursing and some (silly) pictures later and \u0026lsquo;Pizza test post\u0026rsquo; our very first blog post, is made. It\u0026rsquo;s, as you can probably guess all about pizza, home-made pizza in fact. And about now, that seems very appealing instead of more screen time.
