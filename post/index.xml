      <description>When an email went round at work asking if anyone was up for giving a lunchtime talk on a hobby, I volunteered to do so. I’ve got to be honest that I did suspect ‘static site personal blogging’ might be considered a bit too esoteric for them to accept, but no, they took me up on it. Whelp! That’s now done, so, to record the details, I’m also writing it up as a few blog posts&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Here, I&amp;rsquo;m bringing together all 19 book reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve written for fantasy books read in 2024, as originally published on my Bookwyrm account. With the exception of cookbooks, fantasy has always been my most prevalent reading genre (although I’ll admit there’s a bit of presenting myself in a certain way on the internet here as, yes, I do read quite a few light romances too)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Our damson tree had an unusually large crop of fruit this year, so I decided to make a batch of jam. The recipe below details what appears to have worked well. It was adapted from a plum jam recipe found in the book Jams &amp;amp; Chutneys, although the original recipe was for about half the quantity and gave the preparation time as an implausible 20 mins&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Having reached Fort William in 5 days, I was definitely hoping to climb Ben Nevis but was a bit unsure whether it would be a good idea after the days spent hiking. After my first &amp;lsquo;full&amp;rsquo; breakfast of the trip  at the BnB, I decided to first deal with where my &amp;lsquo;no plan plan&amp;rsquo; was going to meet the rigid schedule of the railways&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As we left the story of my adventure on the West Highland Way, it was 10 pm and I had just set up at the wild camping zone at the Bridge of Orchy having covered 104.3 km of the 154 km trail in 3 days of walking. This meant we now had the wildest section of the route to go&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The West Highland Way is the UK’s most popular long-distance path. It’s not hard to work out why – it takes in some of the best of Scotland’s scenery, yet is fairly accessible hiking. Apparently, some 40,000 people complete the entire walk each year, and I was soon to be one of them&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I decided to walk the West Highland Way (running some 96 miles, or 154 km, from Milngavie, just north of Glasgow, to Fort William) after some original solo holiday plans fell through with a couple of months to go. I hence found myself trying to figure out what I&amp;rsquo;d need to do to walk a long-distance path at relatively short notice&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I did it! That is, I finally completed the London marathon 21st April 2024, with a time of 6:33:02. Oh my gosh, has this ever been a lot of hard work – I’ve effectively trained for it three times after first the delays of the pandemic pushed it into 2023, then injury meaning I had to defer to 2024. So my initial reaction to crossing the line was really just one of relief&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally there&amp;hellip; that is past the longest run of training, past the last long run of tapering even, and it&amp;rsquo;s looking more likely than not that 2024 will be the year I really make it to the start line of the London marathon. It&amp;rsquo;s now ~1.5 weeks to go – I&amp;rsquo;m nervous, excited&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>With a lot of hobbies, there’s always the bit that’s the chore. Maybe washing your brushes if you’re painting, figuring out code if you’re blogging, weighing the ingredients if you’re baking (endless washing if you’re running?). With making paper planners, it’s the dating, printing, cutting and punching&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Ok, so for those who don’t know, the London marathon didn’t happen for me this year. I think I’ve always been clear that there was a bit of an ‘if’ getting to the start line. When you are pushing yourself doing runs that are that far, there’s always a risk of picking up an injury&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It’s January. And, for a lot of people, at this time of year, there’s a renewed focus on fitness goals. This isn’t quite the case for me, as I’ve been training for the three-year marathon (yep, still plan to do it, injury excepting) since the start of October. Not quite training like I managed in 2019 and early 2020 but&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>When there’s a big banner for a 10 km race staring at you if you glance out of your office window, it does seem rude not to enter. Mind, this was back pre-pandemic in 2019, not long after I learnt I’d got a 2020 London marathon ballot place and at a point I could actually run a full 10 km&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Where were we; oh yes, we were eloping to Scotland. Wow. It’s still a little scary to think it. And it’s getting even harder to write about. But here’s part two of the ‘haste to the wedding’ story, from leaving home until the end of the wedding day. And for those who don’t know the reason these posts are entitled ‘haste to the wedding’, it will become apparent…</description>

      <description>Well, the secret is out now, after being together 20 years, James and I eloped for a late-summer wedding overlooking the gorgeous Loch Lomond. And as we’ve been asked a few times what prompted this, a blog post seems in order. However, that’s not really so easy to write, not least because this is all quite personal. But, here we are with a little of the story…</description>

However, it’s not me doing the baking - James is the one who’s rather good at scones - so much so, I call his scones ‘the clouds’. Hence, another recipe-sharing blog post&amp;hellip;</description>

As I prepared, I was very pleased to find that I&amp;rsquo;d had some forethought 2 years ago, and had loosened the spikes in the cross country shoes, so they weren’t rusted in place&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s a given that whenever there&amp;rsquo;s some form of software update, I&amp;rsquo;m going to initially dislike it. First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s the disruption of the update itself, waiting for something to download and restart until I get my program back, no doubt occurring at the most inconvenient moment. But then there&amp;rsquo;s also just that it is a change. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I genuinely hate change of course&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>In my previous post about setting up the blog, we were at the stage of having decided on, and got at least somewhere, with getting Hugo working to generate a website, but with much design still to do. And although design can be just going with your preferred template for the content, I want a little more input than that because I do just want a &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; that says &amp;lsquo;coffee now&amp;rsquo; to me, like when you&amp;rsquo;re sat on the sofa with a coffee.</description>

      <description>Text or other blocky elements entwined with background images is a look that’s often used in stickers and planners, and although it looks doable - it’s only combining a few elements together - I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even worked out how to use custom fonts on Procreate, let alone how to only show part of a rasterised text layer without just erasing. But now, after following along with a tutorial published by Holly Pixels (update from the future: no longer available), I&amp;rsquo;ve at least got somewhere on it.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s blowing a hooley out there again, pun intended. Unfortunately, it also did the same on my return to running club this week; sunny before, sunny after, but during a torrential thunderstorm. Two days later and I might be dry but my trainers are still sopping. It&amp;rsquo;s also the day parkrun, a worldwide organisation that helps volunteers run free, weekly, timed 5k events, of which there are hundreds in the UK have confirmed their events won&amp;rsquo;t be back in England on June 5th; but more on that later.</description>

      <description>When you make the decision to start a blog, one of the first things you need to consider is what sort of system you&amp;rsquo;re going to use to organise your content.
If you read any article on starting out blogging, it will almost certainly mention WordPress. WordPress (meaning software available at https://wordpress.org, not to be confused with WordPress.com; see below) is a very common open-source content management system (CMS) for creating websites, including, but far from limited to, those dedicated to blogging.</description>
