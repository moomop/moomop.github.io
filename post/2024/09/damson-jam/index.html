It was adapted from a plum jam recipe found in the book Jams \u0026 Chutneys: Preserving the harvest by Thane Prince (IBSN 978-1-4053-2954-5; I’d also recommend the orange and beetroot chutney recipe from this book) although the original recipe was for about half the quantity and gave the preparation time as an implausible 20 mins.\nThese damsons are ‘merryweather’ variety, which are sweet enough to eat as fruit, although noticeably sharper than a typical Victoria plum.\nJam recipe Ingredients  2 kg damsons 2 kg sugar (we had 0.15 kg being brown sugar for flavour) 500 ml water 4 cm piece of ginger, peeled, sliced and pestled 1 star anise, ground a few pieces of cassia bark plus some ground cinnamon (maybe a teaspoon or two)  Method  Place jars in oven on low heat to sterilise.\nMeanwhile… Cut the damsons in half and remove the stones. Double check no stones got thrown in with the fruit. Put all ingredients in a large preserving pan.   Bring to the boil (takes maybe 15 mins or more). Reduce on a moderate/high heat (rolling boil) until it reaches a temperature of 105°C measured with an electronic probe. This took about 30 or 35 mins. I also tried the wrinkle test (put some jam on a cold plate and push it to see if it flows or wrinkles) and saw slight wrinkling. Turn off the heat and ladle the jam into the sterilised jars using a funnel. This made about 2.5 l of jam, which set overnight.   Given that plums and damsons have a relatively high pectin content, I was worried about over setting (which can lead to the formation of a plum ‘cheese’ instead of a jam). On the other hand, I was also worried that a lengthy boil might have degraded the pectin, but it seems to have worked well.\n Taste test of a left over amount of jam with cream on scones (scones made as per the previous post) was favourable.\nCrumble Of course, another great autumn dish is to use up fruit by making crumbles; a crumble topping is very tolerant of ingredient proportions but, as the crumb, I use:\n 100 g sugar 100 g butter 150 g plain flour  Then add:\n 100 g jumbo oats 30 g chopped pecan nuts   Extra shots  Damson cobbler recipe\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/damsoncobbler_70309 A resource for all things preserving\nhttps://nchfp.uga.edu/  ",

<p>Our damson tree had an unusually large crop of fruit this year (kilos and kilos!), with very few worms, so I decided to make a batch of jam.</p>
<p>The recipe below details what appears to have worked well. It was adapted from a plum jam recipe found in the book <em>Jams &amp; Chutneys: Preserving the harvest</em> by Thane Prince (<a href="https://ramblingreaders.org/book/357379/s/jams-and-chutneys">IBSN  978-1-4053-2954-5</a>; I&rsquo;d also recommend the orange and beetroot chutney recipe from this book) although the original recipe was for about half the quantity and gave the preparation time as an implausible 20 mins.</p>
