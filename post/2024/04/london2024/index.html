However, Iâ€™ve done my training plan and done my best, even if it exhausted me throughout March (culminating in me having to get the bus to work after being far too stiff to do any commuting by bike), and am more than looking forward to hereafter only doing running thatâ€™s just a bit more within my ability (parkrun or my clubâ€™s First Saturday on the Month 5k on Norton Common anyone?).\n As per 2023, I did the Cambridge half as a training race. About a minute slower than last year, but Iâ€™ll put that down to the stones from the gravel path on the new route through Trinity College getting in my shoes.\n  For those that donâ€™t know the story, a TL;DR is I got a ballot place for the London marathon 2020; then when that didnâ€™t happen, I transferred to 2022, and when that moved to autumn, transferred again to 2023 (avoiding summer training ðŸ¥µ and a certain wedding). However, in March 2023, I tore a calf muscle at mile 16 of a 17-mile training run, and had to defer.\nSo, here we are, only 4 years late. For more musings on it all, and a few detours into other running stuff, see other blog entries tagged with London marathon.\nAlthough my place for London is a ballot place, I am taking this opportunity to do a little fundraising for our local hospice, Garden House Hospice, which I go past on my training runs, and for anyone that would like to donate in support of my efforts, a link is below.\nhttps://www.justgiving.com/page/clare-hooley-london2024\n Garden House Hospice do marvellous work providing end-of-life care and support to patients and their families, and I know the money raised will make a difference to their work. This was also the North Herts Road Runners (NHRR) charity of the year for 2019/2020, when I was originally supposed to be running, and with events cancelled that year, many charities found their income reduced, so it feels fitting.\nTo all the coaches at NHRR who have helped so much over the years of me training for this, know that I am beyond grateful; thereâ€™s been some memorable evening sessions every March where youâ€™ve given up your time to encourage us through those downpours while standing there getting drenched yourself!\nFor those at my work, whoâ€™ve had to suffer through me going on and on about never-ending training as it once again took over my free time (and strange squeaks when Iâ€™ve had to get up out my office chair with quads that donâ€™t quite work as they usually do), in way of compensation, Iâ€™ll bring you some marathon cookies. In fact, this is a recipe youâ€™ve seen before, as itâ€™s just my favourite chocolate cookie recipe, but we do call them â€˜marathon cookiesâ€™ in our house as we first made them for Jamesâ€™s colleagues when he did the London marathon in 2014.\nMarathon cookies Makes ten.\nIngredients  100 g butter, softened 125 g light brown sugar Yolk from 1 medium egg 125 g plain flour 30 g cocoa powder 0.5 tsp bicarbonate of soda 100 g bar dark chocolate, roughly chopped 60 g pecan nuts, chopped  Directions  Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolk, then sift in the flour, cocoa and bicarbonate of soda and mix well. Add the chopped chocolate and nuts. Chill the mixture while the oven heats up to 170Â°C (fan). Divide the mixture into ten and roll each portion into a ball. Arrange spaced apart on two lined baking sheets and then press them to flatten them to ~1.5cm thick. Bake for 10â€“12 mins until risen and cracked but still a bit soft and gooey.   I think itâ€™s fair to â€˜congratulateâ€™ myself on having a good deal of stubbornness to get through all the on-offs with marathon training and various associated injuries, but the race will still be hard going and I will be taking a looong time to finish. Iâ€™ll be doing a lot of walking; mostly walking in fact.\nFor anyone following along on live tracking, I donâ€™t start until ~11:20 (bib number 65199), and donâ€™t worry if the pace trails off dramatically in the latter stages â€“ itâ€™s expected that at some point I will run out of run. Itâ€™s certainly not true, as you sadly sometimes see trolls claiming, that those walking and taking 8 h havenâ€™t trained; itâ€™s just our best isnâ€™t that fast because 26.2 miles is a very long way and we werenâ€™t starting our training from the same point as others.\nMeanwhile, please do also follow my short-form marathon posts on social media (Mastodon; no ads/login/tracking), where James will be doing updates on the day. Replies and encouragement, and boosts, from those on the fediverse are very welcome.\nI hope to write a full report of what I make of the day itself in the week after the event â€“ but it wonâ€™t be up that promptly. Iâ€™ll need a good long rest first.\nFinally, very best of luck to everyone else taking part. Weâ€™ve got this.\n Extra shots  Tips to overcome maranoia\nhttps://www.virtualrunneruk.com/are-you-suffering-from-maranoia-marathon-anxiety-and-how-to-beat-it/ London marathon course details\nhttps://www.tcslondonmarathon.com/the-event/the-course   Credits The photo from the Cambridge Half is Â©Sussex Sport Photography and is used with permission.\n",
